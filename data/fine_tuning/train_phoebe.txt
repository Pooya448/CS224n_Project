or we can chant and dance around naked , you know , with sticks .

so if you don t give me that number then i m going to come over there and kick your snooty ass all the way to new glocken  shire .

okay , then you don t know what it feels like when one of them comes back .

but then i figured , he doesn t care if he looks like you .

(so she picks up the latest copy of car and driver  , leans back , and starts reading . )

you guys want to try and catch a late movie or something ?

phoebe , phoebe .

what does it mean ?

i think it is just y'know that i have not been with a guy in so long and how sometimes you are looking for something and you just don t even see that it is right there in front of you sipping coffee oh no , have i said to much ?

okay , because when when he said , i can t wait to hear your first words ,  i thought , there s a trick .

oh , wow , somebody smoked out here ?

but then once i got to know him i saw that he is really sweet and caring and very generous .

damn it woman , pull yourself together !

and you thanks for the face massage .

cliff , do you really believe that a character from a tv show was here in your room ?

believe me , there is something I have been trying to get mike to do in bed and there is .

now , this is just a loan .

all right , so i don t know what sycophant means , but the rest is right .

joey , can i have a sip of your coffee and a bite of your muffin ?

I am going to blow this story wide open !

chandler .

hey , rach !

well , this is none of my business .

nice bucket !

shocking !

all right , i guess I will have to find a new bridesmaid .

i know alice's sister has a pool , but you lived in me .

okay !

stop being so testosteroney !

chandler and monica !

yes , and then i realized I am against that , and uh , so then we bought some ,  uh , boobs .

she cancelled !

all right , what s going on there ?

what do you mean ?

we were playing chess , you said i was boring , and then you took off your energy mask and you were cameron diaz !

yeah ?

you got to take care of yourselves !

when i was you !

uh huh , uh huh .

exactly !

if he wants a date ?

since it s christmastime .

especially ross !

no !

I am asking you as a friend .

quick and painless , watch .

sing !

i have to go !

yeah , i just kind of want to be alone right now .

she just , you know , she s always breaking my stuff .

anyway , he is opening up a restaurant and he is looking for a head chef .

really , can i hear some of it .

oh , fine !

I am sorry , who is this ?

let me just tell my friend .

we are here to make a rather sizeable donation to the children .

what are we going to do ?

yeah , last saturday .

well , a pipe was my weapon of choice and , uhm , pre teen comic book nerds were my meat .

okay , this is inexcusable .

okay , i drive it all the time .

okay , alright , i have a question , then .

i mean , i do not even think you just get one shot .

the bride is pregnant .

whoa , what kind of party was this ?

have a great honeymoon !

you re right , he s just embracing life .

yeah , i like vince a lot , y'know ?

yeah joey that is so gross !

oh .

um , that is it .

i got me some drinks !

i want to , but i just want you to tell me that marriage is not really that big a deal .

yeah , you suck  and shut up and go home  .

get your coat !

ok .

so , here we are .

they are coming this way .

well , maybe it s so big because the house was built on radioactive waste .

sure , what .

all right , just keep playing , just keep playing .

look at him , smiling at me .

yeah !

well , if you are having a hard time , you should talk to my friends , bill and colleen .

well , i , i like the idea of naming him after someone i love , and joey and chandler are great names .

broke his heart .

um , i want to start with a song that is about that moment when you suddenly realize what life is all about .

well , if you think it will help .

there was this one baby , haley , who was favourite to win and she got croup , so she had to stay home !

because you need that .

are you getting nervous ?

i have to tell you this story .

y know ?

no , she s coming to tell ross that she loves him .

god , that would be like telling monica , hey , you like things clean .

what s block ?

okay ?

can you please just be mike hannigan again ?

i got married !

you re kidding !

come on ross , you re a paleontologist , dig a little deeper .

yeah , just , okay , look I am going .

ooh , oh no !

you wouldn t let her have a grape ?

honey , you ve got to go .

trouble ?

helpfully with a to  in the middle .

woof , woof .

yay !

see , he is her lobster .

would you stop that !

obviously , and he s british .

and , he is the kind of guy who , when you are talking , he is listening , y'know , and not saying 'yeah , i understand ' but really wondering what you look like naked .

even more humiliating than  hey , ross !

thank you .

i guess you are right .

hey !

ooh , god , what are you going to bet ?

ooh !

okay .

do you want to learn to play guitar ?

floopy ?

well !

oh good , you are all up .

I am telling you !

i am totally doing it .

umm , hey rach , can i ask you something ?

really ?

oh , is the play over ?

wow .

i am someone !

oh , okay .

wow !

hey look , you guys , it is snowing !

oh .

i didn t want to say anything in front of joey  because i didn t know if he knew yet .

oh but don t tell them monica s pregnant because , they frown on that .

i ve never done that .

yeah , I am going to go back to being street phoebe .

oh , okay , oh .

oh .

god , y'know what , i think five years ago i probably would ve done anything to play with you but , i can do it by myself .

i haven t really had any yet .

oh yeah , oh , she went to the salon alright .

but just so you know .

i kind of liked it .

i really wanted to know how you feel about it .

i liked that better than the law thing , so .

me ?

convince her that that you re scared of commitment !

she did not even know that happened .

a real man wouldn t just run to the hospital !

how about just the bridemaids ?

i know !

if you get two i ll take you .

wow !

start with where .

bing , what an unusual name .

oh , hi joey !

and .

well , that s just the way that goes .

how s the mrs .

this is totally different !

okay .

that is going to confuse my fans .

no , he really hates it .

ross , y know if you ever decide you need to redecorate and i think that you should .

she is already fluffed that pillow .

two bedroom , two bath , must be non smoker , satan worshipers okay   oh , yeah , but it s on the ground floor .

it s kind of embarrassing .

estelle , no , i do not know what I am going to do with her .

god !

but umm , y know just remember that it s still really early , okay so , if it says that i m not pregnant , that doesn t mean that i m not going to get pregnant , okay and , and just please , just so i don t go completely nuts , just try not put all your hopes on this .

he he did not give you any money , he raised his own hand when i asked , who hear likes ross ,  and he is wearing two nametags !

platting goats are platting , leaving little treats .

but , i have company .

i don t think i can help you after all , i didn t realize this game was on .

we can , um , we can burn the stuff they gave us .

because it turns out that the odds are really sucky .

what did you wish for ?

just because you are too lazy to get up off your touchie ?

oh , i wish i could , but i do not want to .

that one doesn t look very fulfilled .

i went shopping with monica all day , and i had a salad .

do not blame the pretty lady .

oh , can i play too ?

but because you re a client , i can t ask you out , even though you give me y know , the feeling .

yeah .

well , i really liked that lamaze class i took !

are you happy now ?

everything .

now some of you are going to get cut , and some of you are not .

when i was in junior high school i went through this period where i thought i was a witch .

yes !

all right , i ll see you downstairs then .

and the good news is you didn t believe in soul mates .

and !

did you find the dress ?

say we are unagi !

good kisser .

sorry frank , I am kind of in the middle of the last favor you asked me to do .

those are my shoes .

so who gets to be yours ?

i ll run out and get you one .

but lately all the guys i meet seem really nice at first , then they turn out to be the biggest jerks .

ok , how about .

if you are not moving forward , you are just staying still .

you didn t leave lipstick marks on the phone .

you got to hear this , it is great .

is it chandler ?

no , you can not arrest me !

you don t , all right you don t have to love each other , okay ?

it is not important .

thank you rachel but , look at monica !

come on !

you should be !

so i just slipped him a little something , you know .

oh my god !

i ordered chinese food .

maybe she has trouble loosening your knots because you are such a high maintenance tight ass !

now , I have never seen anything like that in the business world .

it is tainted .

oh .

some kind of , y'know , like .

susie , can i call you susie ?

you re alive !

oh my god , don t people know , you re not allowed to smoke in public spaces ?

well , it s too late now .

so , uh , why did not you say anything ?

she wasn t a hooker .

umm , anyway i i lived in new york , someone wildly i guess , for umm well since i was fourteen .

why don t you ask him out ?

and i don t want to end up like that with rachel .

okay .

something just brushed up against my right leg !

and then she climbed up the fire escape and she tapped on the window with her teeny little paw and then we ran to let her in  i went to far , did not i ?

hello , coma guy .

sure , yeah .

oh !

most likely .

chandler , easy , easy .

he is just like this , this very passionate , incredibly romantic guy , that got like a tinsy bit carried away , you know .

i don t know , but we re having dinner tomorrow night , so i figured , she s going to tell me then .

i can t believe this !

what stuff ?

i ll have coffee .

oh , yeah !

hello ?

so , why don t we just start over okay ?

really ?

that s sweat .

i had to bring them !

convince her that you re a little coward !

i have just a few questions to ask so I am going to get out my official forms .

okay , I will settle for being your favorite aunt .

ooh , uh   okay , bye !

i can t !

we could not , would not want to wait .

no wait , you do not get to leave !

oh my god , oh my god !

here .

so you are going to move ?

i m still full from your homemade potato chips .

chandler , you stink of cigarettes .

this this isn t going to be easy .

ross !

not in the shaky angry way you are though .

oh yeah , the doctor said that could be one of the side effects .

and then , oh , and then there was randy brown , who was like .

because we re girls .

just ones that haven t been cleaned yet ?

this is the part of the musical where there would be a really good convincing song .

really ?

oh !

well there s one down .

can t believe it is been a whole year !

huh ?

okay , i didn t understand that , but y know , maybe that s  because you were speaking the secret language of love !

maybe we want to be guys !

okay .

oh my god ross !

well , of course i would want to see you .

really ?

crapping on my heart .

oh , this is really .

that oughta do it .

oh no no , no , i made a promise to myself that the next time i would talk to ursula would be over my dead body .

look kiddo , i got to go .

because , every time i go to the dentist , somebody dies .

oh .

so i would sit on it and my step dad would drag me around the backyard .

with the stuff .

you are    you are ruining the plan !

do you know how hard it is to meet a guy like that ?

i knit this .

hey .

i bet that vein on monica's forehead is popping like crazy .

okay .

i m so glad you could make it .

well not so much a pet as , you know , an occasional visitor who i put food out for , you know .

you know .

what is his name ?

take a hike toots !

a freelance massage therapist , uhm .

okay whatever .

okay , then i must be disoriented .

robert !

i love this game !

i m sorry .

yeah ?

um , rachel i m really sorry .

it s the mattress king !

manly and also kind of a slut .

i am , but this wedding is just really important to me .

oh , y know what ?

wow !

thanks .

I am cold !

well , actually it is just from me .

i think we just ran out of kids .

you know .

oh actually , no , i look pretty good .

hi monica !

i forgot i am totally against that now .

why ?

uff , i hope he let us her down easy .

i just i just started walking around not knowing what to do next , y know ?

that s good !

no .

so , she took some fries , big deal !

wow !

the movie ?

ahh !

well the lions technically won , but it was a moral victory for the green bay mermen .

oh i i don t know about that .

would they not go with your tiny portions of pretentious food ?

oh my god !

okay , i know .

i also , you know , prepared a reading  .

joey !

bye .

oh , they ve made so many changes i can t even feel my grandmother s presence anymore ooh !

it s so much better than first grade when you don t know what s going on and definitely better than third grade .

I am sorry , I am sorry !

listen .

no !

leave  yeah , i know because you have all the good words .

smoked a joint ?

and here is this little baby who has like three whole parents who care about it so much that they are fighting over who gets to love it the most .

why ?

yeah well , once again not knocking pays off .

hey guys !

this place is incredible !

do you have any idea how inappropriate that would be ?

oh !

yes .

uh uh .

hemp ?

oh yeah , I am sure .

now if you want to receive e mails about my upcoming shows , then please give me money so i can buy a computer .

oh my god !

yeah and yeah , and it would probably be better than the last telephone job i had .

now i know that they said that the umm , the hair straightener started the fire but i think i m partly at fault .

i just , i just have this really strong feeling that this cat is my mother .

yeah i bet !

maybe the actor richard crenna , he played the commanding officer in rambo .

am i ?

please ?

exactly !

and if you want to look 19 , then you  you got to do something about your eyes .

no , let us just draw straws .

oh no .

oh my god , oh , ok , was that too much pressure for him ?

of all the people i have cut out , you were the only one who ever clawed her way back in .

you suck too .

just change what it means .

oh , i m phoebe buffay .

early colonial bird merchants used to bring their birds to market in that .

i  whatever  stop talking !

sit !

happy thoughts !

I am phoebe .

fine , i ll go call her .

i knew it !

.and i said vicrum you can not just call every time you get lonely you know , you , you gave up that right when you slept with rachel .

i think you do .

but , god , joey seems to be handling it suprisingly well .

now wasn t joey hitting on her at the wedding too ?

okay , i can play this when the guests are coming in .

okay , not a fan of the tough love .

i knew it !

since tomorrow .

that is correct !

oh , that is it ?

anyway , so , ok , joey said that he was fixing me up with his friend mike , only he did not have a friend mike so he just brought , uhm , my mike and , and  but despite , you know .

wow , you didn t rip off any buttons .

you would better get back in that kitchen monica , the garlic is not going to overuse itself .

no .

i never get calls !

hi !

so .

hey , it s your thanksgiving too , y'know , instead of watching football , you could help .

yes , you re supposed to take all of that stuff and put it in a little box in your mind and then lock it up tight .

and how none of it matters when the people really love each other .

because she can sing and play guitar and do both at the same time ?

eh , better her than me !

oh my god , what are we going to do ?

but , i am sorry about the fat ass thing .

oh , we killed them all .

that means he is artistic .

well maybe he was just nervous , y know you can be very intimidating .

you have to get off the plane .

i took this picture from your fridge .

i don t have time have time to convince you because he s only here for four hours , and i m going to go see him !

they shouldn t be living in an apartment .

i have twelve new songs about my mother's suicide , and one about a snowman .

oh , me too !

umm , look it , you you can t kill yourself .

oh , plus it s just , it s so different from the stuff you usually hear .

y know ?

will he know what this is in reference to ?

i did it !

uh , here .

okay .

does he sell it , drink it , or just complain a lot ?

would you rather live in the shirt pocket of a sweaty giant , or inside his shower drain ?

why not ?

oh .

because i just gave birth to three children and i will not let them be raised in a world where joey is right !

i mean , you have always , you know , looked out for me and shared your wisdom .

okay ?

okay ?

you are right .

isn t it funny how we kept running into each other ?

none the less .

and i don t want to end up like that with rachel .

hm mm , corn beef .

i would use y'know the strongest tool at my disposal .

that s so funny to think if you d just done that right after the last contest , no one would have had to move at all .

you did not get the money , did you ?

okay , well i i was kind of hoping that i would just be alone y know to think about my mom and her suicide .

oh monica !

where were you standing ?

i lied .

okay , now .

do you think that s something that he d be mad at you for ?

they require constant care .

no you did not !

you guys , we ve been waiting for you for a long time , maybe you should order .

you guys hang out at the coffeehouse way too much .

yeah ?

here is ross .

you just wrote this !

are you back from minsk ?

look at him !

he is just the sweetest little man !

oh , hey , chandler i want to hug you too !

er , rita , this is my husband .

and now y know what ?

chandler is a great name !

but do not come crying to me when everyone is sick and tired of hearing you play bad , bad leroy brown !

yeah , that does make sense .

i mean , all I am saying is do not judge ross before you get to know him all right ?

ok , you guys , i don t mean to make things worse , but umm , i don t want to live with rachel anymore .

you guys kissed !

oh , no no , this place is totally healthy !

hey ,  you guys should come hear me , ooh hear me .

I would like to start with a song that is about a man that i recently met , who is , um , come to be very important to me .

it is either , you know , that massage was not long enough , or , i do not recognize any of those songs ,  or , you know , these sombreros are not big enough .

well the doctor says it takes a couple days , but my body s always been a little faster than western medicine .

he is already flipping out about everything that is changing .

okay , don t give me a reason to get mad , okay no , look , i told you that i didn t want you to try and sell it , and you just , you big fat did it anyway .

i also have to find a new video store , a new bank , a new adult bookstore , a new grocery store  a new grocery store .

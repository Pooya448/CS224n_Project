we got the house .

please ?

because our guy smells incredible !

i do not get it , i mean , you just got him .

stop it !

okay well , this side looks bigger .

oh , god !

yeah but when he proposed to me with the ring i got goose bumps .

they are these prototype sneakers and come up with ideas on how to sell them which i can not do because no self respecting adult would ever where these .

what ?

oh , good .

well you would not , but we own the paper , we can print whatever we want .

just give us the cheapest room you have .

and .

well that s a full cup !

if i turn into my parents , I will either be an alcoholic blond chasing after twenty year old boys , or .

okay , the old hug and roll .

come on chloe !

yes .

i see where you re goin  !

y know i m i m really glad we decided not to sleep together before the wedding .

so we only have two kids , y know ?

okay ?

sounds like a date to me .

y know if i had just called her after our big , stupid fight , she never would ve gone out with nick , and they would ve ended up in bed together .

yeah , i do .

oh yeah .

ross geller's lunch , who ?

yeah !

tomorrow night is good .

if you are cooking on the stove , does that mean that your new secret boyfriend is better in bed than richard ?

please ?

I am not .

um , i just got out of a relationship and i m not really in a , in a commitment kind of place .

no !

that is great .

y know , it can be more personal .

hey honey !

i was asleep .

I am so sorry , he would not leave .

okay .

please ?

you didn t just break up .

I will be right there emma .

and I am so sad that you are leaving .

wow !

oh wait .

uhm .

the pants are a little tight .

yeah ?

it is the fishnet stockings .

i d probably be writing for the new yorker , getting paid to be funny .

why ?

what are the odds ?

I have got to have the smoke !

well , not at first .

yes .

because i managed to survive whatever it is that killed the three of you !

they re starting to effervesce !

it is like a giant hug .

yeah , come on , it s ross and rachel , they ve got too .

i am *so * bad at this .

say you never feel like a father .

why will not you go out with her again ?

okay .

a hump and a hairpiece ?

it s too nice .

oh no , yes we do my man .

guys !

who walks into a room and asks to see a person s hands ?

so if you want people to see them , then by definition you are not having them taken out .

okay , listen this really hurts .

i think we should spend all of the money on the wedding .

you you massaged me .

a cool phone number , and a possible name for the kid .

I would love to stay , but i have eh .

oh my god !

and , uh , i do not know if you got any of that , but i would really like a copy of the tape .

how long it took to go back in the water ?

yeah , either that , or gloria estefan was right , eventually , the rhythm is going to get you .

no , joey s not here right now , but i can take a message i think .

why is that so funny ?

hello sweet pants !

yeah .

ham stealing and adultery aside .

enunciate !

cry ?

so , the fact that i am a doctor , and my wife s a reverend , that s important to you ?

all right i ll have one .

hey !

monica , there are no words   there are no words !

there is a beautiful woman at eight , nine , ten of the clock !

ooh , that girl that i hate , eww , drives me crazy , eww , eww , oh !

more or less .

maybe the problem was you were pronouncing it kara tay .

oh , come on !

he took my essence !

i can save you time ladies , I am right here .

well it s very unsettling .

and what may be perceived as high maintenance is merely attention to detail and generosity of spirit .

and then you click it and , uh oh , she is naked .

i don t smoke anymore .

so are you enjoying the bike ?

would you give me one minute !

so what happened ?

two nipples , no waiting .

rachel got ross the tuxedo that val kilmer wore in batman .

for me , gum is perfection .

yes it was very sad when the guy stopped drawing the deer !

eh , they re both good .

uh , the book ?

how are you taking it ?

be mad at him !

i see .

she did not have to tell me , i saw the play , and there was no heat .

i do !

what are you guys ?

what s it about ?

if i took this promotion , it would be like admitting that this is what i actually do .

I will catch you guys later .

stop it !

i mean , i can write slogans .

no .

okay .

oh , yeah !

i did not know monica had these !

come on !

I am not saying it was a good idea , I am saying i snapped !

you and i just made out !

what about things that are already gold ?

i m little nervous .

i knew it !

i mean look at pigs .

ross !

remember when we were back in college and we went to that spring dance and you walked right up to that girl you liked and you could not stop talking about the irish potato famine ?

and there is a slight chance i may have told him .

yep !

i mean , who knows ?

oh come on , it was so obvious !

yeah , it is a lot less satisfying to steal pens from your own home , you know ?

i see you later !

so you kissed her , so what happened after that ?

yes , it does bother me !

no i did not !

smoke away .

okay !

that is funny .

monica .

there was no chemistry between you two !

ho , ho , ho !

no , it is like all of the sudden , we were this couple .

no .

i can put gel on it .

ok , you can not do this to me .

i will find out what s going on .

and you  ross , i believe , if you check rachel s bag you will find a half eaten box of cookies in there .

there is some kids playing in the street , you want to go down there and give them a project , ruin their day ?

pheebs .

up until i was 25 i thought the only response to , i love you ,  was , oh crap !

ohh !

hey !

i know .

hi , paul , is it ?

i do not know , i i have to listen to both of them , they do not exactly let each other finish .

she uh , she uh , she uh might have mentioned him .

uh , joey's having an embolism , but I would go for a nip , y'know ?

calm down ?

you roll another hard eight and we get married here tonight .

but in very different ways .

you have got to tell the post office that you have moved .

'gum would be perfection ' ?

i also got this great salt and pepper shaker from the restaurant .

umm , uh , i like her .

let s do it !

oh , that is the wedding march .

okay , so push !

yeah .

we really need to take those tests ?

i thought that was for the actual wedding .

there is not going to be a next time !

oh , is it on the computer , cuz I would love to give it a read .

i mean not as lucky as people who were born with two nipples .

honey , I am old !

of course , i didn t get to enjoy any of that , because joanna s such a big , dull dud !

and by the way , i do not mean to sound distasteful , but when did you start crapping money !

hi .

oh , because we love kids .

i am so much older than these other interns .

well , maybe it is because of the way you are dressed .

always tell her i am sick !

i known ross for a long time .

you win !

y know , i saw a wine cellar downstairs  okay !

oh my god , honey we are so meant to be together .

you guess I am right ?

and you accept !

I am seeing her again on thursday .

the only one around here that hasn t broke a chair , is me !

you didn t think i used to wear glasses , right ?

see , here is the thing : the corn rose were really a solution to your frizzy hair problem .

and that would have made the official party line .

see ?

alone .

when you said unpaid  it sounded like you said unpaid .

is it just me , or can you actually see his abs through his overcoat ?

y know what ?

he s not like other people , on your first date he took you to rome .

joey !

yes !

ooh , she is asleep , that means we can .

married people aren t supposed to have secrets between one another .

why i m such a girl ?

I am sorry .

so what was phoebe s secret ?

am i crazy to be this upset ?

i ve been taking dancing lessons .

oh yeah .

i just moved in next door and i was wondering if you would be interested in battling me in a post apoplectic world for control of the galaxies last remaining energy source ?

i don t know if i ve told you this , but he s kind of tried to get in contact with me a lot over the last few years yeah , he s made phone calls , written letters , he even came to new york , but i always said i was too busy to see him .

i feel really strongly about this , rachel .

doogie , shh !

all right .

no , she just died today !

this this embarrassment thing is all in your head !

okay , first I am not crazy .

i was just saying that so you d think i was a good person .

monica's going to totally freak out !

uh huh !

you tired chandler ?

i knew it !

can not seriously be talking about me taking one of your kids , can we ?

both it is , thank you .

yeah , it s totally meant to be .

alright , wait , so what you are saying is that the chef is at the hamilton club , but the food is not and the drinks are there , but the bartender is not ?

what ?

except for , y'know when you re on a date and you re getting along really great but the guy s translator keeps getting in the way .

but do not you think it might be different with someone else ?

look at what i got !

we could set ross and rachel up on horrible dates , so that they will realise how good they are together .

ew !

are you asking me out ?

i don t accept this rule .

come on , play that funky music white boy .

unless .

oh , it s so great to see you feeling like this !

you can go first .

everything ?

today is mike and my one year anniversary .

umm , y know they want you so much , so when you guys get in there , really grab on .

a cartoon of cigarettes .

i was the last one to know when chandler got bitten by the peacock at the zoo .

oh , i see .

wow ?

do think it really doesn t hurt ?

yes !

you got to scare people off .

i want to trade lives with ross  nothing , I am excited about our date , mike this is ross geller this is mike haaaaa  uh huh  how do i look   no well it was awful every time i thought about what you said i started crying .

I am wearing pantyhose !

well , since the fire was kind of my fault i guess  you should get to stay here .

and i thought it was a really good idea .

uh huh .

just because i think they re soul mates doesn t mean anything s going to happen .

yeah !

my candle !

smelly cat , smelly cat , it s not your fault .

god , i woke the beast .

yes !

that can not be good .

all right everybody !

n.y.p.d !

well , maybe she did not hear !

oh my god , this is a police badge !

I am in .

okay .

she is driving me crazy !

yeah !

we will just tell her the date's off , but we do not tell ross , and he goes to the restaurant and gets stood up !

it was my idea !

you re welcome .

oh no , the mendels , they hate all living things , right ?

i would trade .

well , lots of people !

yeah , this is fun , couples night .

before i start , i just want to say that umm , i have a cold , so if i sneeze in the middle of song , it is not on purpose .

you guys , you know what i just realized ?

but no , because a doctor won t be able to help him , it s just going to y know naturally pass through his system in like seven years .

your in your thirty's and you have never had a serious relationship and you have never been in a long term relationship , here you go from woman to woman , meaningless experience to meaningless experience never even worrying that it does not tern into anything serious .

oh , look i know you probably want to be alone , and you don t want to talk about it , that s fine .

how can  don t interrupt me !

hi paul !

well , we called everyone in your phone book and bunch of people came , but it took us so long to get you here that they they had to leave .

oh hey !

y'know , it is .

this is so hard !

well , i would just really love it if you would do it .

i know !

look , this will seem a little weird , but you put your head inside this turkey , and then we will all talk , and you will hear everything we say .

nice try .

for tiny salt !

you don t hire an assistant because they re cute , you hire them because they re qualified .

ross , get ready to do some serious crying .

i thought i told you to get outta here !

all right , fine , now i get it .

chandler .

frank jr.jr .

 everyone gets a goodbye but me ? what have i got to do to get a goodbye , huh ? be best friends with you ? uh , go out with you ? have a baby with you ? oh wait a minute , wait a minute , i did all those things .

 uh oh , saved by the bell .  hello ?
 no no no , that s great ! i ll be there monday . and thank you again !  okay .   umm , that was the head of the paleontology department at n uh , y , uh u !
well remember that paper i had published last year on sediment flow rate , huh ? they loved it .
i know ! anyway , they asked me to be a guest lecturer ! i mean it s temporary , but uh , if they like me it could lead to a full time job . how great would that look great on a mailbox , huh ? professor geller . 
 hey everyone !
hey uh , well , today s my first lecture and i kinda wanted to try it out on you guys , do you , do you mind ?
 there are three primary theories concerning sediment flow rate . each of these theories can be further subcategorized into two distinct  
   subcategories . the first of these subcategories is  
no ! why ?
ohh ! okay ! okay .  there are three  primary theories concerning sediment flow rate .   each of these theories  can be further subcategorized  into  
open with a joke ? it s a university , not a comedy club !
 okay !
thank you !
please don t say naked chicks .
i i i don t even know why i bother to talk to you guys about it . y know what ? i m just gonna do it on my own with no naked chicks .
 hello !
it went great ! and i didn t need any jokes or naked chicks either !
i knew all i had to do was let the material speak for itself . everyone s all , ross you have to be funny and sexy .  well , i proved them wrong ! and now , i m gonna pass the news onto joey and chandler .
that s right !
 right ! so when rigby got his samples back from the laboratory he made a startling discovery ! what he believed to be igneous , was in fact sedimentary . imagine his consternation when  oh bloody hell .
look , i was nervous ! you guys had me all worried i was going to be boring ! i got up there and they were all like staring at me . i opened my mouth and this british accent just came out .
will you will you please ?
oh .
 i m sorry , i ve got plans with my sister .
 right , will you excuse us for one moment ?   what are you doing ?
just please stop !
 look , i really need some help , okay ? why ? why did i have to speak in a british accent ? ! what do i do ?
they re not listening too me ?
monica you really think i should try this phasing out thing ?
 all right , keep going . we are phasing the accent out , phasing it out . so without out re testing the results in the laboratory  the team would never have identified  the initial errors in their carbon dating analysis  . were there any questions at this point ?  yes . 
 come again ? what s what s this nonsense ?   all right , i m i m not english . i m from long island . i was really nervous and the accent just uh , just came out . i m sorry . so , if we could just get back to the lecture . umm , were there any questions ?  about paleontology .  all right , look i was just trying to make a good first impression . obviously , i screwed up . but what you guys think of me is really important because i m i m hoping to get a permanent job here . so if you just give me another chance to make a good impression 
 well , hello rachel !

i don t think so ! you re just giving me ruth so you ll get to name it when it s a boy , and that s when you ll swoop in and name him heath or blaine or sequoia .
veto .
unless   you anticipated that i would figure all this out and you know that it actually is a girl , and you really do want her to be named ruth ! well , i m not falling for that ! okay ? ruth is off the table !

well , maybe he just didn't want to hurt your feelings .
what kind of problem ?
nooooo !
so , i just finished this fascinating book . by the year 2030 , there'll be computers that can carry out the same amount of functions as an actual human brain . so theoretically you could download your thoughts and memories into this computer and and and live forever as a machine .
hi ! 
so uh , wha uh , what do you do ?
thank you for bringing her into our lives .
yeah , yeah man don't do it . i mean if you date her , then then then i can't date her .
monica had such a crush on him . yeah , she used to kiss his poster every night before she went to bed .
yeah .
hey !
 wow , couples who live together do start to look alike . so , mondler .  uh , what uh , what  cha doin ?
did you get monica's authorization to move all of her stuff ?
put it back exactly where you found it ?
 kay , first of all , this attitude is not helping .
whoa , hello , did you just meet monica ?
hmm  you know , actually this'll work out well . cause when you have to move back in with joey , joey's hot new roommate can come and live with me .
look chandler , monica is really weird about this kind stuff all right . believe me , i lived with her for 16 years . she is going to freak out . oh my god , she's going to sit on you .
yeah , the phone was facing the other way .  and that goes back up there .
yeah that that , doesn't look right .
whoa , whoa , but then the back of the couch won't line up with he back of the carpet .
whoa , whoa , whoa , but then the coffee table won't be centered in the seating area .
hey , i've been married 3 times
look , we do not repel women ok ? that is completely untrue .
yeah , well what about you ? you weren't you know , so hot in college either . after everything he said , he'd go ba dum bum chessh 
oh y'know what , girls don't like it when i start talking about science .
uh , they don't like it when you correct their grammar .
they don't like it when you keep asking them if they like you .
 i'm never gonna find love again .
who cares ? i repel women .
 what ? !
why does anyone have to be naked ?
i i had to show chandler something ?
yeah yeah i uh , i have a uh , a guy problem .
dude , what'd you have ?
 the photo album ! there were millions of pictures of the apartment in the photo album . we just go through it and match everything to the pictures .
so really , what'd ya have ?
bye ! 
so it said that by the year 2030 , there'll be computers that can carry out the same number of functions as an actual human brain . so theoretically we could download our thoughts and our memories into this computer . . .
that's so janine , you you you know what , do you know we're doing right now ? you and i , we're interfacing .
i m sorry the answer there would be .  none of us .
yeah , i ll take some .
what ?
hey , y'know while we re on that , when are you gonna tell my sister that you don t live here anymore .
phoebe , she doesn t know that you sneak out every night , she doesn t know that you sneak back every morning , and she doesn t know that you ve been living with your grandmother s for a week now .
hey .
so how many more do you have tomorrow ?
 sure , your dresser is missing but this she notices .
i have to go . yeah , carol should be home by now , soo . . .
oh , better , actually . y'know i i i think i finally figured out why we were having so much trouble lately .
yeah , y'know how i have you guys , well she doesn t really have any close friends that are just hers , but last week she meet this woman at the gym , susan something , and they really hit it off , and i i i think it s gonna make a difference
no real   , honey , really it s fine , just g go with susan . really , i , no , i think girls night out is a great idea . okay , okay , bye
i don t know , something girlie .
 hi . where is everybody ?
my marriage , i think my marriage is um , is kinda over .
 cause carol s a lesbian .  and , and i m not one . and apparently it s not a mix and match situation .
 i m an idiot . i mean shoulda seen it , i mean carol and i d be out and she d , she d see some beautiful woman , and , and she d be ross y'know look at her , and i d think , god , my wife is cool !
well , now i do ! !
seven years . i mean we ve been together seven years , she s the only woman who s ever loved me , and the only woman i ve i ve ever . . . .
maybe this would ve happened if i d been more nurturing , or i d paid more attention , or i . . . had a uterus . i can t believe this !
thanks .
thanks . 
wait , wait , wait , wait , wait .
wait , wait , wait .
my foot is stuck in the pocket .

okay , okay . ooooh , ooh maybe i rode in on a harley .
well , um , actually , i i took her to the planetarium . that s that s where we had our first date . um , she walked in and i had the room filled with lilies , her favorite flower 
then , fred astaire singing the way you look tonight came on the sound system , and the lights came down . and i got down on one knee and written across the dome in the stars were the words will you marry me ? 
oh , no , mom , it s just monica this year .
no , of course , um  um , everybody ? um , i i just wanted to say on behalf of my new bride , rachel  , and myself . umm , that if if in 35 years , we re half as happy as you guys are , we ll count ourselves the luckiest people in the world .
 and then , we could ve gone from the ceremony to the reception with you in the sidecar !
but having a dove place the ring on your finger would ve been no problem ?
yeah ! and ! and , it was the easiest 400 bucks i ve ever made .
yeah .
i know , i know it was stupid .
no , actually i thought about it when , when we were going out . it s how i imagined i uh , i would ask you to marry me .
it s a good thing i didn t do it , because it sounds like it would ve been a very expensive wedding .  okay , good night
even if the sidecar had a windscreen so your hair wouldn t get messed up ?
that s all i m askin 
y know i don t understand why they didn t cry . it was a beautiful speech .
hey ! all that stuff you said about true love , you were right , i mean , we did learn a lot from mom and dad ! and that picture of chi chi with her mischievous grin . and what you said about nana . ohh , yeah she really would ve wanted to be there . and you know what ? i think she was .
not that big a deal ? it's amazing . ok , you just reach in there , there's one little maneuver , and bam , a bra right out the sleeve . all right , as far as i'm concerned , there is nothing a guy can do that even comes close . am i right ?
multiple orgasms !
not even , say , breaking up with janice ?
tony ?
oh , yeah , last week you had a wonderful , nutty , chocolatey kind of a cakey pie thing .  nothing , just , just , i'm fine .
that guy , he burns me up .
so , uh , rachel , what are you , uh , what're you doing tonight ?
oh , you uh , you wanna hear a freaky coincidence ? guess who's doing laundry there too ?
me . was that not clear ? hey , why don't , um , why don't i just join you both , here ?
yes , i do have a laundry room in my building , um , but there's a . . . . rat problem . apparently they're attracted to the dryer sheets , and they're goin ' in fine , but they're comin ' out all . . . . fluffy . anyway , say , sevenish ?
 ok , bye .  well , monica's not coming , it's just gonna be me and rachel .
it's laundry . the thinking through is minimal .
nuh uh .
so what're you saying here ? i should shave again , pick up some wine , what ?
 no .
ok , ok , now what is wrong with my snuggles ? what , it says i'm a sensitive , warm kinda guy , you know , like a warm , fuzzy bear . ok , i can pick something else up on the way .
what's goin ' on ?
was your basket on top ?
so ?
no suds ? excuse me , hold on a second .  that's my friend's machine .
hey , hey , hey , that's not the rule and you know it .
 all right , show's over . nothing to see here .  ok , let's do laundry .
well , that's because you're such a sweet , gentle , uh .  do you , uh , do you .  oh , hey , uh you must need detergent .
uberveiss . it's new , it's german , it's extra tough .
rach , do you uh , are you gonna separate those ?
rach , have you never done this before ?
uh , well , don't worry , i'll use the gentle cycle . ok , um , basically you wanna use one machine for all your whites , a whole nother machine for colors , and a third for your uh , your uh , delicates , and that would be your bras and your under panty things .
 uh , that , that , that would be a judgment call .
that does not sound stupid to me . you know , it's like the first time i had to make dinner for myself , after carol left me ?  i'm sorry , that's all the time we have . next on ross . . . uh oh .
 uh oh , uh oh , the laundry's done . it's , uh , it's a song . the laundry song that we sing .  uh oh the laundry's done , uh oh , uh oh .
nothing , nothing . lee lo , the laundry's done .
all right , all right , it's just that you left a red sock in with all your whites , and now , everything's kinda pink .
yeah , uh , except for the red sock , which is still red . i'm sorry , please don't be upset , it could happen to anyone .
you got the clothes clean . now that's the important part .
you were incredible ! brand new woman , ladies and gentlemen .
ok , um , uh , more clothes in the dryer ?  i'm fine , i'm fine .
no .
yeah .
yeah .
what a beautiful story . hey , i'm fine by the way .

yeah , i kind of uh , have something else planned for you guys .
sorry , i m kinda keeping this one on the q.t .
what ? a brain transplant ? !
it s ridiculous !
 it s winter , they are fewer people on the street . 
yeah yeah , help me out here , when you come out of the brain transplant ,  you are going to be her ?
what ? !
oh well , it sounds to me like your family is ready to uh , rediscover its scottish roots .
well yeah yeah the scottish history is so much more 
how did you know about that ? !
were you the ones called the cops ? !
why not ?
come on that s not fair ! i mean you haven t even heard me play !
no , you ve heard my practice . okay ? just just give me a chance to perform for you and then decide whatever you want . and i m not going to tell you what song i m gonna play either . but uh , let s just say when it s over i ll bet there will be a we bit o  celebration .
 now remember you have to imagine me in a kilt .

phoebe he s right , that is the rule .

oh what s the big deal ? ! i wasn t even invited to the ceremony , just the reception . and and y know what ? if it makes you feel any better , joan and i will just make an appearance and then , and then we ll we ll leave early as a sign of protest .

it s nothing , i just gave her a hug .
it s also a sign of friendship .
 it was a hug !

i was hugging her as a friend . it s not my fault her her hair got in my face , she s got a lot of it and it smells all all uh coconutty .  what ? ! oh , that doesn t mean i have feelings for rachel ! maybe it means i have feelings for coconuts !
 if the place you are referring too is being in love , then she is in the same place as me because i am not in that place !
 hey !
rach , uh , you still looking for a place ?
okay , there s this guy , warren , from the museum and he s going on a dig for like two years and he s got this great place he needs to sublet . so uh , you interested ?

 okay okay ! two very good points , look i ve known you both a long time , and i ve never seen either of you one/millionth as happy as you ve been since you ve got together . do you really want to throw that all away over a room ? that is so silly . now wh what is more important , love or silliness ?

 yeah , i didn t think of that .
so are you sure about this whole moving in thing ? ! i mean it s a really big step ! and and what s the rush ? !
no , i i i m serious , okay ? i mean , think about it . you move in , you start fighting over stupid game rooms , next thing y know you break up !
okay , there are no stupid fights ! ! this isn t about the room , this is about what the room represents ! and unfortunately , this room  could destroy you ! !
fine ! it s your life !  i just don t want to see you guys break up ! which you will do if you move in together ,  but that s what you want , there s nothing i can do .  don t do it ! ! ! ! ! 
 so umm , where are the other guys ?

emma .
well we haven't offically asked them yet , but we would want monica and chandler .
well . . its just . its just in that case , then um . emma would go to my parents .
yeah and we'd want to make sure emma has someone like monica who is more uh . uh discliplinarin . . someone who can be firm and strict .
no , you both are equally capable . its just . . you're strongest when . . when you're together .
sure , monica would have to give her up .
hey dude , you okay ? sorry about before .
emma .
dude . well done . you know what ? if i die , and rachel dies and monica dies then you can totally take care of emma .
so , so now do i get joey ?

marcel , stop humping the lamp ! stop humping ! now marcel , come back    come here , marcel  
what ? it's , it's just a phase .
would you all relax ? it's not that big a deal .
what ?
 hi .
at the vet .
she says marcel's humping thing's not a phase . apparently he's reached sexual maturity .
she says as time goes on , he's gonna start getting agressive and violent .
i'm gonna have to give him up .
i know . i know . i mean , one day , he's this little thing , and before you know it , he's this little thing i can't get off my leg .
no , no . the vet says unless he's in a place where he has regular access to some . . . monkey lovin , ' he's just gonna get vicious . i've just gotta get him into a zoo .
well , we're applying to a lot of them . naturally our first choice would be one of the bigger state zoos , y'know , like , uh , san diego . . . right ? but that might just be a pipe dream , because , y'know , he's out of state . uh , my vet , uh , knows someone at miami , so that's a possibility .
what ? ! are you insane ? this woman stole from you . she stole . she's a stealer .
yeah , which she probably stole from some cheerleader .
 oh god .  we didn't get into scranton .  that was like our safety zoo . they take like dogs and cows . see ? i don't know who this is harder on , me or him .

there it is .
hey .
whoa , whoa , whoa . you looked at her . you never look . you just answer , it's just a reflex . do i look fat ? nooo ! is she prettier than i am ? noo ! does size matter ?
and it works both ways .
okay , for instance . let's say , janice is coming back from a trip and she gives you two options . option number 1 she'll take a cab home from the airport . option 2 is you can meet her at baggage claim . which do you do ?
 wrong ! now you're single . it's actually secret option number three , you meet her at the gate . that way she knows you love her .
oh .
uh , yeah , yeah i'll , i'm right behind you .
bye sweetie .
 okay the sleeping thing . very tricky business , but there is something you can do .
noo ! no , not cuddlily , not me , just her . i'm like you , i need the room . okay , come here .  okay , you're in bed . . .
i'm gonna use the cushion .
okay , you're in bed . she's over on your side , cuddling . now you wait for her to drift off , and then you hug her  and roll her back over to her side of the bed . and then you rollll a way . hug for her ! roll for you .
yep .
shoot .
oh my god , you've got a crush on your sister's stalker .
what are you talking about ?

how's the maniac ?
you're taking the word of a guy who has night vision goggles ?
 hello .
 hey .  uh , chan , can i uh , can i talk to you for a second ?
just one uh , one additional relationship thought . probably something your already familiar with , uh , women talk ! 
emily's cousin kicked me out !
well , when you're subletting an apartment from your wife's cousin and then you get a divorce , sometimes the cousin suddenly wants his apartment back .
who needs a lease when it's family !
you got it .
thanks you guys , i really appreciate this . all right , i'm gonna get packing again . man , i've been moving around so much i'm beginning to feel like a nomad .
what ?
 hey roomies !
oh , yeah i know , i know , it's a lot of boxes , but again i really appreciate you guys letting me stay here .
oh , i uh , hope you don't mind , i kinda uh , jazzed it up a little . check this out .  we will , we will , call you back !
pretty cool , huh ?
 joey , please ! 
 uh fellas , 
i'll take sports .
all right . uhh , international .
well , i guess i can check out those apartment listings , even though there's never anything in here .
 oh yeah ! you're hey , you're right ! here's an affordable place ,  two bedroom , close to work , ooh , it's available in five weeks !
oh , i i don't know , it's kind of expensive for a studio .
okay , let's go .
oh oh ooh , hey guys , i was wondering if you guys would uh , maybe chip in on some new air filters for the air purifier ? i mean after all , we all are using it .
oh my god ! 
i think this is it . i don't know , maybe we should keep looking .
 so , you you think i should go ahead and take this place ?
 how about you ?
all right , i see what you guys are saying . i'll uh , i'll go downstairs and fill out an application .
hey . so i uh , i didn't get that apartment . some problem with my application .
yeah . but , the good news is that phoebe said that i could stay at her place for a while . so 
look , you guys don't need me here taking up your space .
are you guys sure about this ?
all right .
so i'm a pimp huh ? it's okay ! look , i know that sometimes i can be a pain in the ass , but you just have to talk to me . tell me if something is bothering you . okay ? and for my part i will do everything i can to keep my annoying habits just  .
 come on , it's fun !
yeah , it does sound interesting , i mean , to listen to a woman complain for two hours , i don't think it gets bett . . . 
what ? how come that you don't have to go !
hey !
hey , you guys won't believe what i have to do for work today .
  there're these two professors who are joining my department and i have to meet them here and show them around campus .
it's i just know they're gonna be a couple of windbags wearing tweed jackets with suede elbow patches .
 these aren't suede .
hi , hi , i'm ross geller .
oh , oh , that's , that's , that's nice .
oh , no , it's no big deal , i mean , if i weren't doing this i'd just , you know , be at the gym working out .
oh , ha , i wrote that in one minute .
  we should probably get going , you know , we got a lot of ground to cover .
i don't think so .
oh , well he's obviously late and the rule in my class is if you can't come on time , then don't come at all  .  an option that many of my students use .  shall we ?
you know what , he's a big boy , i'm sure he'll find us , ok ?
oh , damn it !
 so , where did you get your undergraduate degree ?
 oh , it's not over !
so basically all nuts ?
i've lost the will to live .
what ?
oh . . . ok , fine . but . . . ehm . . . i just have one question for you , ehm . . .  when we exit should we walk , or run , or prance , or stroll . . .
 oh , hey you guys ! this is charlie ! charlie , this is phoebe and my sister , monica .
yeah , charlie is gonna be joining my department .
 ranion's theory of species variegation ?
oh my god , she's great ! i mean , we we have so much in common and she's just cool , and funny . . .
really ? wh what's wrong ?
i'm sorry , rachel , this is charlie wealer , she's a collegue .
 wh what's going on ?
no , i arranged that . . .
 so , eh . . . it's probably gonna be hard for you to leave boston , huh ?
ooh . . . so sad . . . still , it can't be easy for you to leave harvard ? especially after working alongside a nobel prize winner like albert wintermeyer ?
you . . . you dated albert wintermeyer ?
 . . . and you called him alby ! ?  i mean that's like . . . like calling albert einstein . . . er . . . alby . . .
eh , you think ? i mean , you went out with a guy who improved the accuracy of radiocarbon dating by a factor of 10 !
 oh ! like what ? !  oh i'm sorry , i don't mean to pry . . . it's just that this must be what regular people experience when they watch access hollywood  .
who is intimidating to a guy who won the nobel prize ?
 two ? wha . . . ? don't tell me you dated benjamin hobart
oh my god ! have you ever been in a relationship with someone who hasn't won the nobel prize ?
oh yeah ? no , no nobel prizes for him ?
huh . . . huh . . . what a loser ! some more wine ? 
 oh great ! after i finish my wine i'm going to blow my . . . eh . average sized brains out .
she . . . she only dates geniuses and nobel prize winners . oh my god , at the chinese restaurant earlier today , i put chopsticks in my mouth and pretented to be a woolly mammoth .
of course you would , your brains are smaller than mine ! !  man , i can't compete with the guys she goes out with , they are so out of my league ! oh my god !
oh much , much worse . i did my impression of joan rivers as one of the earliest amphibians . . .  can we walk  ?  oh , you . . . you like that ?
what ? 
nice to meet you .
oh , i'm no actor , i'm a professor of palaeontology .
oh , well no , but i mean , she only goes out with really , really smart guys .
i'd lead with that .
just some boys gave me their phone numbers .
it's actually a 1,000,000 $ prize .
yeah , maybe . i do have my whole career in front of me . i mean , i can still win a nobel prize . although the last two papers i've written were widely discredited .
and sexy .
yeah , you're right , thanks pheebs , i'm gonna go find her .
stop going through my stuff  !
 hey rach , have you seen charlie anywhere ?
i'm smarter than him !
 yes , of course they like you !
 yeah , they don t like you .
i dunno , maybe it s because you re really sarcastic . or maybe it s cause you uh  
 no i don t want to play video games , joey !
for real ?
yeah , see , we we we have to stop across the hall , because it s my sister . but , uh , uh y know actually , growing up with a sister was nice because it really helped me understand women . yeah , you you should tell your friends that .
and the place looks so nice !
happy thanksgiving !
see ya !
oh , oh , we did say we d stop by this little thing joey s roommate is having .
some would say she s attractive , yes .

beef in a dessert ? ! i   no no no , there is no way !
oh my god , the pages are stuck together !
oh my god , she she made half a english trifle , and half a .  sheperd s pie !
no , no , we will . we just won t tell her she messed up .
yeah , it ll be like a funny thanksgiving story !
 dude , i need to talk to you a sec .
okay , i think i might know why my parents don t like you .
okay , remember , we were young . hey , spring break , sophomore year , i got high in my bedroom and my parents walked in and smelled it and so i told them that you had gotten stoned and jumped out the window .
i don t know , aheh , your s was the first name that that popped into my head , i m i m sorry . i i didn t think it would matter .
how was i supposed to know we d end up being friends after college , let alone you you would be living with my sister ?
i don t know , i i was all high .
okay , okay , i ll tell  em it wasn t chandler who got high . now who should i say it was ?
alright , alright , now now who should i say tricked me into doing it ?
okay , fine !
oh , uh , can it wait a second joey ? i have to tell my parents something . no it can t ? okay .
what ? ! what is with everybody ? it s thanksgiving , not .  truth day !
okay , okay , we ll just get everyone to act like they like it . that that way noone makes fun of her and we still get to go to sweet potatoe pie ! 
hey rach , can i talk to you outside for a second ?
so um .  thanksgiving . the holiday season is upon us , hm ?
and um .  you look nice today .
what ?
 eh ?
 you re alone .
 ah well , can t blame a guy for trying !
wha ? no no ! ah !   all gone ! so good ! maybe chandler has some left .
it tastes like feet !
are you kidding ?
oh yeah , about telling mom and dad , i was thinking about maybe writing a letter .
wha what ?
  you are such a tattletale ! mom , dad , you remember that that time you walked in my room and smelled marijuana ?
well i told you it was chandler who was smoking the pot but it was me . i m sorry .
yeah , well , hurricane gloria didn t break the porch swing , monica did !
monica and chandler are living together !
i i uh , i got tricked into all those things !
 hey !
how come ? everybody else does .
oh , umm , i'm just getting rid of a couple of things .
yes , yes it is ! no , but it's good it's emily thinks we should get all new stuff . stuff that's just ours , together . y'know brand new .
touched . used . sat on . sleep on .
look , if i can just do what emily wants and get her to new york , i'm sure everything will be fine .
after what i did ? can you blame her ?
 no no no , it's just a bit sudden .  no , it's great . okay ? i'm totally on board . i love you too , all righty . bye . 
nothing . oh , actually , great news ! i just got off the phone with emily and it looks like i'm moving to a new apartment . woo hoo !
well , her thought is , and i agree , fresh new furniture , why not a fresh new apartment ? her cousin has this great place to sublet , it's got a view of the river on one side and columbia on the other .
yes ! yes ! i mean it's it's kinda far from work , but uh , y'know , i'll get so much done on the commute . i i've been given the gift of time !
 i know i miss you too . i can't wait to see you . i love you . bye . 
no no , this is my collection of fossil samples .
i'm really gonna miss this apartment . y'know , ben ben took his first steps right over there . 
i loved this place ! to tell you the truth , i wish i didn't have to move .
well , i mean if uh , if emily gave me a choice 
why ?
what's going on ?
unreasonable ? how about we have this conversation when one of you guys gets married ! you have no idea what it takes to make a marriage work ! all right , it's about compromise ! do you always like it ? no ! do you do it ? yes ! because it's not all laughing , happy , candy in the sky , drinking coffee at central perk all the time ! it's real life , okay ? it's what grown ups do ! 
yep .
y'know what ? i'm really not in the mood .
look , this is hard enough ! i really need you guys right now .
okay . thanks you guys . pheebs are you wearing fur ?
you do , huh ?
what are you talking about ?
wait ! wait ! wait ! y'know what ? just stay . please ? it uh  it would really mean a lot to me if you stayed .
hey ! hey , look ! ugly naked guy's back !
hey !  yeah yeah , we're just having dinner .  uh , yeah , sure uh hold on .  she wants to say hi .  hold on .
y'know what ? uh , rachel is here ! 
yeah , yeah , she's here .
 hi .
 look emily , i'm just having dinner with my friends , okay ?
emily that's ridiculous . look , i'm i'm moving for you , i'm cutting friends out of my life for you . please , just get on the plane and come to new york . okay , you'll see you're the only person i want to be with .
well , you can't know where i am all the time . look , this marriage is never gonna work if you don't trust me .
so , can you trust me ?
well , i guess that's it .
my marriage is over .
yeah . you can help me get my furniture back from gunther .
ironically , most of the boxes seem to be labeled clothes .
hey ! hey ! if he's moving , maybe i should try to get his place !
it would be so cool to live across from you guys !
oh my god ! i love this apartment ! isn't it perfect ? ! i can't believe i never realized how great it is !
 ohh . 
 what's going on ?
what ? ! what ? !
actually , it looks really good . 
 hey !
well , i called over there and it turns out ugly naked guy is subletting it himself and he's already had like a hundred applicants .
no no , i got the edge . i know it's not exactly ethical but i sent him a little bribe to
no .
no .
a basket of mini muffins .
the small one .
well yeah ! someone sent us a basket at work once and people went crazy over those little muffins . it was the best day .
oh man ! i want that place so much ! ! i was so sure that was gonna work ! there's twelve bucks i'll never see again ! 
noooo .
look i've already looked at like a thousand apartments this month and none of them even compares to that one !
huh ?
that is a great idea ! and ! i know ugly naked guy because we've been watching him for like five years so that gives me back my edge ! oh , let's see now he had the trampoline .
well , he had gravity boots .
okay , i've got to go pick up ben but i i will figure something out .  hey , didn't he used to have a cat ?
right . 
good evening , sir . my name is ross geller . i'm one of the people who applied for the apartment . and i i realize that the competition is fierce but i'm sorry . i , i can't help but notice you're naked and  i applaud you . man , i wish i was naked . i mean , this this looks so great . that is how god intended it .
a new place for a new ross . i'm gonna have you and all the guys from work over once it's y'know , furnished .
well i am that . and that whole rage thing is definitely behind me .
oh donald that that would be great . i am totally ready to come back to work . i what ?  no ! wh  what are you doing ? ! !  get off my sister ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
marcel . bring me the rice , c'mon . bring me the rice , c'mon . good boy . good boy . c'mere , gimme the rice .  thank you , good boy . well , i see he's finally mastered the difference between 'bring me the ' and 'pee in the ' .  'bring me the ' and   rach ?
hi .
really .
whoah , uh , what happened to , uh , 'forget relationships ! i'm done with men ! ' the whole , uh , penis embargo ?
wait wait . i , i got it . i was there .
yes . yes . yes ! yes , i really do ! in fact , it's funny , very often , someone who you wouldn't think could could curl your toes , might just be the one who . . .
 .  gets interrupted . hi !
alright , i've gotta go . c'mon , marcel ! c'mon ! we're gonna go take a bath . yes we are , aren't we ? yes , we are .
that's right , you're gonna spend tomorrow at aunt rachel's , aren't you .
'pwease , aunt monica , pwease ? ' oh , unclench . you're not even gonna be there .
i'm telling you , she said she's looking for a relationship with someone exactly like me .
well , i added the 'exactly like me ' part . . . but she said she's looking for someone , and someone is gonna be there tonight .
well , i think it's perfect . y'know , it's just gonna be the two of us , she spent all day taking care of my monkey . . .
anyway , i figured after work i'd go pick up a bottle of wine , go over there and , uh , try to woo her .
hey . how did , uh , how'd it go today ?
yeah . you , uh , you want some ?
uh , okay , yeah , we could do that , but before we head off to the murder capital of the north east , i was , uh , kinda wanting to run something by you . y'know how we were , uh , y'know , talking before about , uh , relationships and stuff ?  well  
okay , quick and painful . 
oh , what ? what what ?
 .  yeah ?
 i   i   i ca   i can't believe this . i mean , all i asked you to do was keep him in the apartment .
no , y'know what , i guess it's partially my fault . y'know , i shouldn't've , uh , asked you to start off with a monkey . i should've started you off with like a pen or a pencil .
you called animal control ?
marcel is an illegal exotic animal . i'm not allowed to have him in the city . if they find him , they'll take him away from me .
that's right , i . . 'cause i didn't expect you were gonna invite them to the apartment !
yeah , we thought we had a monkey , but we we didn't .
cat !
my uncle marcel .
marcel ?
marc   oh , this is ridiculous ! we've been all over the neighbourhood . he's gone , he's he's just gone .
oh come on . it's cold , it's dark , he doesn't know the village .  and now i have a broken foot . i have no monkey , and a broken foot ! thank you very much .
yeah , yeah . y'know , now that you kicked the sign , hey ! i don't miss marcel any more !
oh , no no no . nono , this is just vintage rachel . i mean , things just sort of happen around you . i mean , you're off in rachel land , doing your rachel thing , totally oblivious to people's monkeys , or to people's feelings . . .
i don't even wanna hear it , you're just . . .
oh , forget it , okay ?

my dad wanted to know if you wanted to play racquetball with us .
yeah and he didn t really ask for you , he asked for chancy , i assumed he meant you .

or you can sit with him on the front porch and make sure no one steals the trash cans . he does that every week too .
yeah .
you re not a lefty ?
oh , we have to get you an engagement present ?
no one got me an engagement present .
two ! i ve been engaged twice !
 hey .
well i had a great time ! umm , chancy on the other hand 
and what did he ask you not to call him ?

 cause otherwise they d have to call it the room room .
now , i know you wanted to bond with my dad , but did you really have to bond to that part ?
oh , but he will . he still tells the story how monica tried to escape from fat camp .
then how did you get caught in the barbed wire ?
you were trying to eat it !
whoa whoa , aren t you a little over dressed ?
 hey are you getting monica and chandler an engagement present ?

uh .  sure i do , and i also wanna be king of my own country and find out what happened to amelia earhart .
the woman just vanished !
no ! do you know what your odds are of winning the lottery ? i .  i mean you have a better chance of being struck by lightning 42 times .
seriously you guys , i can't believe you're going to spend 250 dollars on the lottery , i mean that's such a bunch of boohaki .
oh oh , we think emma is about to start talking so we're trying to be careful about what words we use in front of her .
they're towing your car , they're towing your car ! !
they're towing a car . and i am seeing .  spots .
yeah , uh . . . and then i figured after you win , we could all go out to the balcony and see a night rainbow with gremlins dancing on top of it !
think he washed his hands ?
yeah if only it were a sure thing like your 24 state lottery !
a psychic and a wishbone ? guys ! give someone else a chance !
you know what , i'm sure your wish is gonna come true , but , you guys    just in case , maybe a genie will come out if we rub this lamp !  ah ! ! that thing gets hot ! !
uh , you're not gonna win .
ok , i've heard myself on tape and i sound nothing like that .
why would i eat my own arm ?
why ?
you don't have to do that , i'll pay for myself . but just the fact that you want me to have fun with you guys    that's so sweet ! come here 
i don't know , probably just invest it .
oh , i'm sorry , did i say invest it  ? i meant be cool and piss it all away  
 uh , how long until they announce the numbers , mommy ?
oh , i've gotten into the habit of calling rachel mommy  when we're around emma . which i now realize we are not  . . .
although if we're gonna do that , we should probably call me daddy  too .
i  . . . i was just talking about rachel .
 well that depends  . . . have you been a baaad gi  . .  no i can't .
i can't believe this , i thought we were all in this together !
3 minutes ago ! ! ! i don't know why that's important  . . .
than i want mine , too  ! and if i win i'm gonna put it all into a very low yield bond .
 hey , hey ! !
monica !
go , go , go ! !
weird . . your psychic didn't mention anything about the scary pigeon . . .
oh yeah , it's a good idea !
 goodnight sweetheart ! i love you . and remember , you're daddy's little girl . . .  phoebe's totally ruined that for me . . . 
oh , we have one too ! !
 come on ! !
oh yeah , no no no .  that's great !

yes you did , gleba is a word !
ok , use it in a sentence .
it's not a word !
oh , oh , ok , great . you know what , while you're at it she said another word the other day , why don't you , why don't you look up : pbbqqt . . . .
she's gonna be a scientist ! 
me too . so much for my dinosaur/amelia earhart theme park .
phoebe , you don't have any of the first five numbers .
i guess if everybody else is . . .
she barely knows me . we just live in the same building .
she lent me an egg once .
aw , right .
hey . 
an egg ?
i think it's insane .
hi . she said yes .
i'm just sayin ' if dogs do experience jet lag , then , because of the whole um , seven dog years to one human year thing , then , when a dog flies from new york to los angeles , he doesn't just lose three hours , he loses like a week and a half .
the blond woman is my ex wife , and the woman touching her is her . . . close , personal friend .
if you wanna put a label on it .
nope , nope , that's it .
oh , and she's pregnant with my baby . i always forget that part .  helloo !
so , um , what do you do for a living ?
now that is funny . hey , do you think .  would it be too weird if i invited carol over to join us ? 'cause she's , she's alone now , and pregnant , and , and sad .
are you sure ? great . carol ? wanna come over and join us ?
come on . these people'll scooch down . you guys'll scooch , won't you ? let's try scooching ! come on . come on . uh , kristen riggs , this is carol willick . carol , kristin . uh , carol teaches sixth grade . and , kristin , kristin . . . .  does something that , funnily enough , wasn't even her major !
you did so . i swear , i swear  how long has she been in the bathroom ?
well maybe it's cold in there . or maybe i screwed up the first date i had in 9 years .
oh , god .  you know , this is still pretty hot . 
no , it's just .  you know the whole getting on with your life  thing . well , do i have to ? i mean , i'm sitting here with this cute woman , and , and , and she's perfectly nice , and , but that there's , that's it . and um , and then i'm here talkin ' to you , and , and it's easy , and it's fun , and , and i don't , i don't have to .  you know , here's a wacky thought . um , what's say you and i give it another shot ? no no no , i know what you're gonna say , you're a lesbian . but what do you say we just put that aside for now you know ? let's just stick a pin in it , ok ? because , we're great together , you know . you can't deny it . besides , you're carrying my baby . i mean , how perfect is that ? but see , you know , you keep sayin ' that , but there's somethin ' right here . i love you .
no but , no but .
that's easy for you to say , you found one already .
hey ! what are you guys looking at ?
yeah ? wow ! it looks really violent !
now i cannot wait to see this .
uh sweetie , maybe you d be more comfortable here ? 
look , i i know how miserable you are , i wish there was something i can do . i mean i wish i were a seahorse .  because with seahorses it s the male , they carry the babies . and then also umm , i d be far away in the sea . 
 hey is rachel here ? we have a doctor s appointment .
rach , we gotta go .
people ask me why we re not together , i just don t know what to tell them .

mmm ?
wow !
oh nothing . nothing ! just uh , you ve been a little short with me lately . i m not trying to irritate you .

hey pheebs , you know i'm i'm really glad you came to talk to me the other day and i hope i was a little helpful .
good , good . yeah coz the more i thought about it , the more i realised i don't think marriage is neccessarily the right path for you .
well , i know the other day in the coffeehouse you were caught up in the whole soccer mom thing ? but is that really you ? i mean can you honestly picture yourself in a volvo ?
i don't know you'd be so bored with marriage . i mean it's so . . . normal .
hey hey , can i help ?
you know sometimes your words . . . they hurt .
pheebs , what's wrong ?

 hey !
guess who's a finalist for a huge research grant ! i'll give you a hint , he's looking right at you .
oh , i'm so excited , i mean , apparently i beat out hundreds of other applicants , included five guys i went to graduate school with . not that i'm keeping score or anything . . . five !
well , ok , it's for 25 thousand dollars . and if i get it , i'll finally be able to complete my field research ! and there will be an article about me in the paleontology review  ! yeah ! that'll be the first time my name is in there , without people raising serious questions about my work !
yeah . why ?
your ex boyfriend ?
so , your ex boyfriend is gonna determine if your new boyfriend gets this grant ? wow , your new boyfriend is screwed !
well , if you think it would help .
ok , now , is there anything i can do to . . . you know , butter him up ? anything he really likes ?
we'll see how dinner goes .

well , i . . . i am having a good hair day .
i'm ok .
it's an honor to meet you . i can't tell you how long i've been an admirer of your work , i mean , that nobel prize ,  whoooo ! i mean , i have to tell you that , you're one of the reasons i got into the field .

your ex boyfriend is insane .
no i didn't , and you want to know why ? because your ex boyfriend is still in love with you .

really ? is it ethical to ask someone in a grant review , who was the voice of underdog  ?
if you don't believe me , let's go talk to him , okay ? i'm telling you , he didn't ask me one paleontological question .
oh , i'm sorry , no . he did ask me one . uhm . . . how do you spell mboscodictiosaur ?

oh c'mon ! when we were kids , yours was the only raggedy ann doll that wasn't raggedy !
alright , you madcap gal . try to imagine this . the phone bill arrives , but you don't pay it right away .
because you're a kook ! instead you wait until they send you a notice .
monica ? you're mom .
c'mon , seriously , joey , what's the part ?
you're right , you're right , it is .  so you gonna invite us all to the big opening ?
look at it this way : you dumped her . right ? i mean , this woman was unbelievably sexy , and beautiful , intelligent , unattainable . . . tell me why you did this again ?

it felt like a 'big guy ' moment .
yeah , i mean . . . i think when it's your shot , y'know , you you know it's your shot . did it . . . feel like your shot . . ?
she is a kook .
so , uh , what kinda stuff do you think they'll have you do there ?

hey , you'll never guess what just happened  phoebe and i got mugged !
 yah , because phoebe knew the mugger !
you wanna know how she knew him ?  because phoebe used to mug people .
well , anyway , it was a good thing phoebe knew the knew him , because  i was about to do some serious damage !
yeah , it was pretty traumatic . i was outside st . marc's comics  you know , i i i was just there minding my own business , you know , seeing what kinda trouble spiderman got into that week  
anyway , i was heading towards this bakery , you know , to pick up a couple of dozen linzer torts for someone     when outta nowhere this thug with a pipe jumps out and says : gimme your money , punk ! 
i know ! and and the worst part was they took my backpack which had all the original artwork i had done for my own comic book : science boy 
a superhuman thirst for knowledge .
well , i i better get to class  are there any more of your friends i should look out for on my way , phoebe ?
hey !

well , it was the only thing to do there that didn't have a line .
come on .
 and you didn't marry him because . . . ?
probably . but you know , i'll tell you something . passion is way overrated .
it is . eventually , it kind of . . . burns out . but hopefully , what you're left with is trust , and security , and . . . well , in the case of my ex wife , lesbianism . so , you know , for all of those people who miss out on that passion . . . thing , there's all that other good stuff .
but , um . . . i don't think that's going to be you .
uh uh . see , i see . . . . big passion in your future .

i honestly don't know if i'm hungry or horny .
 grab a spoon . do you know how long it's been since i've grabbed a spoon ? do the words 'billy , don't be a hero ' mean anything to you ?
y'know , here's the thing . even if i could get it together enough to   to ask a woman out , . . . who am i gonna ask ? 
i assume we're looking for an answer more sophisticated than 'to get you into bed ' .
you got a job ?
the word you're looking for is 'anyway ' . . .

it's been sixteen years but the air quotes still hurt .
that's ok . uh , anyway , well he and i both really liked you a lot , uhm , but we didn't want anything to jeopardize our friendship , so we kinda made a pact , that neither of us could ask you out !
yeah , why ?
you did ?
 and on my turf ?
 you made out with missy goldberg . how could you do that , after you promised me ?
you broke the pact !
that doesn't matter ! we're talking about the foundation of our friendship .
i didn't .

i never did anything with adrienne turner .
i don't know what . . . you're talking about .

okay , after you told me she was passed out in our room , i went in there to make sure she was all right . she was lying on my bed , all buried in peoples coats . well , i went to kiss her on the forehead , you know . but it was so dark , i accidentally got her lips . i started to pull away , but then i felt her start to kiss me back . it was only for a second , but . . . it was amazing . and now , now i find out that you kissed her first .
mine .
no , she was definitely on my bed .
well , then who was on my bed ?

oh , on a date . yeah , i met this girl on the train going to a museum upstate .
okay , it was just me and her at the back of the train , and i sat near the door , so she d have to pass by me if she wanted to switch cars . she was totally at my mercy .
no , i m getting back down  cause she lives in poughkeepsie . she seems really great , but she s like totally great , but she lives two and a half hours away .
oh , wow ! i should get going . i i got a date tonight .
you know that girl i told you about who lives up in poughkeepsie ?
not her . yeah , this is someone else i meet , and i i can t decide between the two of them . y know the one from poughkeepsie , even though she s a two hour train ride away , is really pretty , really smart , and and a lot of fun . but this other girl , well , she lives right uptown . y know she s , well she s she s just as pretty , i guess she s smart , she s not fun .
well , i i want to give her another chance , y know ? she lives so close . and , at the end of the date , the other time , she she said something that was if she was kidding was very funny . on the other hand , if she wasn t kidding , she s not fun , she s stupid , and kind of a racist .
hey !
i wasn t sleeping .
the one with the cat . i gotta go , i ve got another date .
no , it turns out that the one from uptown was making a joke . but it was a different joke than i thought it wasn t that funny . so i m still torn .

married couples send out cards , families send out cards , people who have been dating for a couple of months do not send out cards ! what what is she crazy ? !
hey !
huh . wow , this is great .
well , we we haven t said that to each other yet , but i guess its okay to say it to other people .
a hundred ? ! well , i i guess i ll take a mona , uh i i m not sure about the whole uh , card thing .
sending out a holiday card , together , i mean i just don t know if we re really quite there yet .

really ? ! i mean , even with the card ?
 hey !
oh yeah , yeah we re moving forward . you ll be getting our card !
yeah , we re not just doing a card ! y know , she she also wants to have the conversation about where the relationship is going .
i know ! i know ! why do you guys need to have this conversation ? ! huh ? i mean no self respecting man would ask a woman , so , where is this going ? 
hey ! you were a closed book ! okay ? i m not a mind reader ! besides , i hate those conversations . i m horrible at them . really ! maybe maybe i need kind of a gesture . y know , something that says we re moving forward without having to talk about it .
smaller than that .
uh , bigger than that .
whoa hello ! we were closer with the mixed tape .
yeah i i don t i don t think i m quite there yet , but i could say i looove spending time with you .
forget it . i i y know what ? i ll just have the conversation . i ll just say i like things the way they are , and hope for the best . what do you think rach ?
here we go . mona umm , i think it s time we we had a conversation about about where things are with us .
aw , we we are so  so umm , well i i i like you and i i love umm , y know hanging out with you . and i mean i m having a lot of fun . 
i mean , there s no point in spending time with someone if if it s just fun . it s gotta be , it s gotta be going somewhere right ? so where where is it going ?  ah ! that s that s the real question . and and the answer is is it s going somewhere fun . now i i know what you re thinking , fun was fine for you like ten years ago y know , but you re you re not getting any younger . no i mean no not you , not you , you you are getting younger . i mean you you look like you re getting younger by the second what s your secret ?

okay , y'know how you told me i should do whatever it takes to fix my marriage ?

 is for me not to see you anymore .
it's awful i know , i mean , i feel terrible but i have to do this if i want my marriage to work . and i do , i have to make this marriage work . i have too . but the good thing is we can still see each other until she gets here .
you have no idea what a nightmare this has been . this is so hard .

i'm going to the bathroom . 
 pheebs , you mind if i speak to rachel alone for a sec ?

y know what ? fine ! get attacked ! i don t even care !
unagi is a state of total awareness . okay ? only by achieving true unagi can you be prepared for any danger that may befall you !

pheebs , we had the most incredible night ! okay , so , we're in the car 
okay , okay , so we're in the car . right ? and bang ! a shot was fired . and joey with no regard for his own safety throws himself on me !
yeah , but but he didn't know that !
and it could've just as easily have been a bullet .
wow ! i could've died tonight .
i do have a newfound respect for life .
rach , what uh , what are you doing here ?
y'know , it it doesn't matter . the important thing is that you're here . you're my friend , and you're here . oh ! 
the most amazing thing happened tonight . i thought my number was up . i had an actual near death experience !
okay , okay , we were on the ride along with gary , right ?
and somebody took a shot at me !
no , a car backfired , but  i thought somebody was taking a shot at me . and rach , i i survived ! and i was filled with this this great respect for life . y'know ? i i want to experience every moment . i want to seize every opportunity . i i am seeing everything so so clearly now .
 okay , why are you here ?
you talked to her ?
well , okay , what what did she say ?
wow !
huh ? yeah ! yes , of course !
right . i guess , i guess i should call emily .
okay , look , yesterday i would've even considered calling her back , but my ex wife calls on the same day i have a near death experience . i mean , that that has got to mean something !
you weren't there ! okay , maybe this is something that i i'm supposed to seize ! y'know ?
huh .
that does make sense . because i do wanna seize some opportunity , but i i really don't wanna see or talk to her .
yeah . maybe today is just , close call day .
hey , thanks rach . 
oh wait wait wait ! the message is blinking . maybe you didn't erase it .
 hey ross , it's you !   oh yeah , no that's that's an old message , nobody needs to hear that .
 hey umm , was was monica here ?
yeah , i want my money back .
hey pheebs , has gary ever been shot at for real ?
i wonder how i would react under fire , y'know ? and not backfire but but heavy fire , like i was in a war or something .
i know where joey would be . he would be down in the foxhole protecting all of us .
hey ! i just got uh , my teacher evaluations ! check out what this one student wrote , i loved dr . geller s class . mind blowing lectures ! dr . geller , you are definitely the hottie of the paleontology department ! 
oh , i wish i knew , but the evaluations are all anonymous .
yeah .
it s a girl ! anyway , it wou it wouldn t matter . okay ? because i m a teacher and she s a student .
no , but it is frowned upon .
besides , there s a big age difference .
i know when i m 90 she ll be like 80 and it won t seem like such a big difference .
 yeah ?
oh thank you . thanks very much .  ow ! 
that was you ?
oh i , i don t i don t think that would be the best idea .
what time ?
gotcha . 
oh ! so so seriously , what time ?
what ? of course i did ! you uh , you sat next to sleepy sleeperson .
oh uh , i had trouble remembering everyone s name , so i i kinda came up with nicknames . like the guy on the other side of you was smelly von brownshirt .
umm , no . no .
umm , it s cutie mcpretty .
listen , i gotta tell ya , i i m having a great time ! y know how before you said it might be weird , the whole student teacher thing , and to be frank i thought it would be too , but it s not . i mean it s not at all .
 burt !
we had such a great time ! she s she s incredible ! i thought the the age difference might be a problem , but it wasn t . it wasn t at all . elizabeth is very mature for her age .   a concept lost on some people !
well , not really . i mean technically it s it s not against the rules or anything , but it is frowned upon . especially by that professor we ran into last night , judgey von holierthanthou .
yeah . what what should i do ?
going out with who ?
oh yeah ! wasn t she uh  
what do you want to do now ? huh ? you wanna go get a drink ?

wow ! it actually is in the handbook . i can t date you or have a hot plate in my office . i can t believe we have to stop seeing each other .
i know , i know i really like you too . but we we can t date . it s against the rules . it s forbidden .
what ?
really ?
well i i i don t care how hot it is it s it s uh , it s wrong .
 no ! no ! it s wrong ! it s it s it s naughty . it s taboo .
let s also get a hot plate !

oh , right , because he's a scientist !
ok , we gotta go , yeah ? so , we'll see you guys tomorrow .
it's a blanket joe , not a cloak of invisibility !

  . . . sarah . i dig you  , uh ? doctor ross geller  .
yeah , oh and sarah . . . i'd like to introduce you to my colleague , uh , professor wheeler , a and this is joey tribbiani .
dude , it's just days of our lives  . . . there's no the .
hey !
 you're never going to guess who i just saw downstairs !
yeah , she never misses these conferences !  no , i just saw dr . kenneth schwartz !
yeah . . . what am i going to say to kenneth schwartz ?
 ready to go ?
yeah .
 i'm good , i have dinner plans  .
uh , joe , have you looked outside ?
by using ct scans and computer imaging we can in a very real way , bring the mesozoic era into the 21st century .
oh and you know what , it will be even better tomorrow , because i won't be constantly interrupted by joey checking to see if they put chocolates on my pillow yet .  .
the chocolates aren't here yet .
if you want to check your email , just ask ! 
wha . . . what do you mean ? 
what , oh my god . what did you do ?
why , why would you open it ?
what did it say ?
what . . . what am i gonna do ? my speech is gone , chandler !
no ! i don't ! !
yep ! i'd like to thank you guys for coming down here to complain about the rain and ruin my career !
yeah , well you should ! i mean , nude pictures of anna kournikova ? i mean , she's never even won a major tournament !
get out ! 
well , what do you do ?
i can't believe this . i can't believe this is happening . i have to give the keynote speech tomorrow ! ok ? i have to stand up in front of all these people . what am i gonna say ?
i don't think that your monologue from star wars is gonna help me right now , joe !
wha . . . what you really think we can do that ?
alright , ok , let's do it .  uhm , i know we start by discussing the shortcomings of carbon dating . . . uhm , and then , then i move on to what is clearly the defining moment of the mesozoic era , the breakup of pangea , hello !  and then , there's the . . . eh . . . there's the overview of the triassic .
yeah , that's it ?
oh my god , we did it ! 
yes , but i did make a pyramid out of the bath products . this is amazing , thank you , thank you so much .  that's a pretty necklace .
hey , what do you say we celebrate ? champagne ? 
oh my god , i love you .
that's ben , my son from my first marriage .
yeah .
no . 
 oh , it was . . . it's complicated , you know ? she . . . she was . . . eh . . . gay .
ok , odd thing to get excited about !
hey ! high five ! 
my wife had a workout friend she went to the gym with everyday for a year . she didn't get any fitter .
i know ! it's like , if you knew , why didn't you tell me , you know ? i mean , call , or leave a note : hi , i just dropped by to say your wife's gay 
and then , you try to make the best of a bad situation , so you float the idea of a threesome ?
 me neither .
yep , we got it , we got it .  thank you so much .
good night .
 walls are pretty thin , guys !
then we have to await the data from recent mri scans and dna testing which call into question information gathered from years of simple carbon dating .
finally , factoring the profusion of new species recently discovered : gigantosaurus , argentinasaurus . . .
and that's just the herbivores . i'm not even gonna discuss the carnivores , their heads are already too big . which is ironic considering their stunted cerebral development .
but all kidding aside , in much the same way that homo ergaster [1 ] is now thought to be a separate species from homo erectus . . .
 . . . and while there are certainly vast differences between these mesozoic fossiles and the example of homo erectus . . .
 . . . in a very real way we can bring the mesozoic era into the 21st century .  thank you !
oh , thanks guys !
oh !
 ok . . . now . . . now we're just holding hands ! 
oh , thank you so much !
 ok ! . . . all right , thanks ! thank you so much , you guys !  oh , i can't tell you how much it means to me that you were here !
 ok ! . . . uh . . . excuse me ? yeah ?
hey !  well . . . ? 
yeah ?
oh , i can't tell you how great it was to look at the crowd and see your face ! i mean . . . uh , did you know you were  mouthing the words along with me ?
no , it's ok ! made me feel like a rock star !
 i'd better not found you naked in my hotel room !
 look , i took it too far !
ooh , well . ah , i kinda have got a lot on my plate right now , not that i wouldn't love a weekend in the country with a strange man . 
get out !
yes , please !  so , what's going on ?
oh my god , wh what happened ?
i knew that was him !
 hey , you ok ?
oh , professor clerk we're kind of in the middle of a conversation , here .

hi .
yeah . the bartender said that they split up into two search parties , the herbivores and the carnivores .  you know , we as a group are not the coolest .

they published my paper .
how could you have told her ?
oh , she didn't think it would be that big of deal .
look , that was supposed to be like a private , personal thing between us .
that's different , okay . that's like , uh 'who dated a stripper ? ' or 'who did it on the back of the staton island ferry ? ' .
yeah . look , you don't , you don't talk about like , you know , your girlfriend and the intimate stuff you , you do with her .
noo !
hmph . so what you , you tell each other everything ?
did you talk about the night of five times ? do you tell people about the night of five times ?
i know , but it's still worth mentioning , i think .
women tell each other everything . did you know that ?
no chandler , everything ! like stuff you like , stuff she likes , technique , stamina , girth . . . .
rachel says sharing's great and supposedly , you know , we outta be doing it . do you wanna ?
nooo !
yeah ?
okay , okay , i'll go first .
so , uh , the other night rachel and i are in bed talking about fantasies , and i happened to describe a particular star wars thing . . . .

okay .
hmph .
with the belly button ring ? oh , muhawa !
your mom , your telling me , your telling me , about your mom , what is the matter with you ?
i said 'share ' not 'scare ' . go sit over there !  .
no , no it's , um , it's not you , um , it's um , it's 
i hate chandler , the bastard ruined my life .

free cats do that too , y'know . {which reminds me , if i might get a little political here , support your local animal shelter . pet shops are not the place to buy dogs and cats from , you get a much better deal from the shelter , plus they probably won't die on you in a week and a half . if you want a leash , go to the pet shop . if you want the dog for that leash , go to the shelter and save it's life . now back to regularly scheduled programming . }
 hey , you wanna get something to eat or uh , do you wanna see how long we can throw this ball back and forth ? huh ?

wait a minute , you guys . oh , i wanna ask you something . i i i may get to speak at this paleontology convention and if i do , i'd love for you guys to come and hear me .
it's in barbados .
so so what did the doctor say ?
how do you feel about all this ?
 what ?
 what ? no ! i am not going to give them ben !
the data we are receiving from mri scans and dna testing of these fossils are    are staggering .
 i mean , we've been accepting leakey's dates as a given , but if they're off by even a hundred thousand years or so then you can    you can just throw most of our assumptions , you know , right in the trash .  so so what i am saying is    is is that  is that the repercussions could be huge ! i mean , not just in palaeontology , but if if you think about it , in evolutionary biology , uh , genetics , geology , uh , i mean , truly the mind boggles !
oh , that's not what you want . . .
joey ! hey , i need to talk to charlie . is she there ?
i'm meeting with professor sherman about my being the keynote speaker . . .
it could be better ! he , uhm . . . he fell asleep !
barbados .
what am i supposed to do ? he's out cold ! in fact he was just talking in his sleep before and evidently he wants someone named fran to spank him harder .
i can't ! if he realizes that i'm the one that put him to sleep , i won't get the job !
 oh my god ! you really want me to be the keynote speaker ? thank you ! 
hey , you re not going to believe this . i made up a joke and sent it in to playboy . they printed it !
yeah , they print jokes , interviews , hard hitting journalism . it s not just about the pictures .
 here , check it out . it s the first one , too .
what ?
uh , oh oh , no you didn t . i did .
hey , tell dan ,  thanks . 
what ?
look , chandler , it s my joke . but , hey , if it makes you feel any better they don t print the name , so it doesn t really matter who gets credit , right ?
no , it s my joke , it s mine . you can call them , they ll tell you .
it s my joke .
you know , barracuda was the first song i learned to play on the keyboard .
what , you didn t get it ? the doctor is a monkey .
your joke ? well , i think  the hef  would disagree , which is why he sent me a check for one hundred ah dollars .
well , i was going to stick it in the atm , but now i think i ll show the sexy teller that i am a published writer .
oh , what are you going to do , follow me down there ?
well , i m not going to go now anyway  .
 oh , hey , gunther , check this out .
uh , yeah , i ll take a coffee . thanks , man .
yeah , why would it be weird ? hey , joey , can i get some coffee ?
seriously , i i asked you before and you still haven t gotten it .
joey , seriously , can i get my coffee ?
it s my joke .
y know , i don t think we re going to settle this .
yeah !
hey mon .
monica ! 
yeah .
yeah , but i m your brother . we re family . that s the most important thing in the world .
we ll each tell you how we came up with the joke and then you decide which one of us is telling the truth me .
see , i would never snap at you like that .
are you kidding ? okay , look . i i studied evolution . remember , evolution ? monkey into man ? plus , i m a doctor , and i had a monkey . i m doctor monkey !
it s your joke .
no way .
guys ? there's a somebody i'd like you to meet .
'that ' would be marcel . you wanna say hi ?
my friend bethel rescued him from some lab .
yeah . i mean , it's been kinda quiet since carol left , so . . .
nah , i dunno . . . i think you reach a certain age , having a roommate is kinda pathe     . .  sorry , that's , that's 'pathet ' , which is sanskrit for 'really cool way to live ' .
how could you not get it ? you were santa last year .
come here , marcel . sit here . 
just a smidge .
c'mon , this was a pact ! this was your pact !
okay , look , he's not gonna hurt them , right ?
i didn't wanna leave him alone . alright ? we   we had our first fight this morning . i think it has to do with my working late . i said some things that i didn't mean , and he   he threw some faeces . . .
oh , that'd be great ! okay , but if you do , make sure it seems like you're there to see him , okay , and you're not like doing it as a favour to me .
so tell me something . what does the phrase 'no date pact ' mean to you ?
okay , so on our no date evening , three of you now have dates .
four .
five . 
okay , so i'm gonna be the only one standing there alone when the ball drops ?
hey , y'know , this is so not what i needed right now .
oh , it's it's marcel . he keeps shutting me out , y'know ? he's walking around all the time dragging his hands . . .
really .
what , uh . . . what juggling thing ?
no .
par tay !
'that thing ' ? this is how you greet guests at a party ? let me ask you something , if i showed up here with my new girlfriend , she wouldn't be welcome in your home ?
okay . he was more embarrassed about that than anyone . okay ? and for him to have the courage to walk back in here like nothing happened . . .
thank you .  c'mon , marcel , whaddya say you and i do a little mingling ?  alright , i'll , uh . . . catch up with you later .
 look at him . i'm not saying he has to spend the whole evening with me , but at least check in .
perfect . perfect . so now everybody's getting kissed but me .
 i wanted this to work so much . i mean i'm still in there , changing his diapers , pickin ' his fleas . . . but he's just phoning it in . just so hard to accept the fact that something you love so much doesn't love you back .
oh yeah , let me just finish this .
have you seen this ? it's a new alumni website for college ! it's cool ! you can post messages for people , let everyone know what you're up to .
it's actually kinda interesting to find out what people are doing . . . remember andrea rich ?
uh uh . . . well , her internet company went under and she lost an ear in a boating accident . . .
no . . . i already e mailed her .
you know what ? i'm gonna finish this later , ok ? let me just grab my coat .
 what do you think you learnt how to do in the last two minutes ? ? 
 alright , let's go !
i think you made it clear you cannot be trusted with the ball inside the house !
 i have sex with dinosaurs ? ?
that only is not funny , it's physically impossible ! ok ? depending on the species i'd have to have a six foot long . . .  it's not funny ! !
i can't believe you put that on my alumni page !
you'd better hope not because i just read what you put on your page today .
oh oh oh ! i respectfully disagree ! !
 i'm dead ?
posting that i died ? that really isn't funny .
oh please , hit by a blimp ?
unbelievable , my classmates are gonna think i'm dead , my professors , my . . . my parents are gonna get phone calls . you're messing with people's feelings here .
you've really crossed the line here , but that's okay , it's ok 'cause i'm on my way to buy some photoshop software and a stack of gay porn . that's right ! your coming out is about to get real graphic .
uhu uhu , check this out . 
eh  actually no , i don't need to because your little ross is dead  joke didn't work , ok , there were no responses . nobody posted anything on the website , nobody called my parents , so the joke my friend is on you . nobody called , nobody wrote anything , nobody cares that i'm dead .  oh my god ! nobody cares that i'm dead ! ?
what are you talking about ? you get sixty responses just for coming out of the closet ! i didn't get one response ! and i'm dead !
i can't believe this . not even my geology lab partner ? and i carried that guy ! 
you're right . there isn't a decent outlet .
exactly ! ! 
no ! that would be stupid ! you're having it for me !
oh , too late , too late ! it's sent . . . oops sorry and so is the picture of you and the police man . . .
it's been an hour and not one of my classmates has shown up ! i tell you , when i actually die some people are gonna get seriously haunted !
ok , ok ! i'm gonna go hide ! oh , this is so exciting , my first mourner ! 
who is he ?
i don't remember him , but then again i touched so many lives . 
 i'm dead and no one cares ?
it isn't ridiculous , look around ! no one's here !
yes , you're right . still somebody must have seen it . . . i mean , i went to that school for 4 years , i didn't have an impact on anyone ?
 yeah . . .
 but you didn't ! i'm still alive ! ! kori , i know this is a big surprise for you . it's a long story but the things you just said really made my day ! i mean , the fact that you are here means more to me than if this room were filled with people !
did you hear that ? kori weston had a crush on me ! !
 no mum , i'm not dead . i know it's not something to kid about . it was just a practical joke between chandler and me , but it's over , ok ?  actually no , even if i had died , you would not be left childless .  monica ? dude , that reverse lay up ! oh 
amazing !
oh , you guys call him cute coffeehouse guy , we call him hums while he pees .
it s not a club .
hey , divorced men are not bad men !

hi .
listen , you are hearing one side of the story , okay and f.y.i she must ve shown kyle over 30 paint samples before she painted that room ! and his response to each one was , i don t give a tiny rat s ass . 
well , i don t think we are gonna have that problem , but maybe that s just because i am not emotionally unavailable !
i think he can be .
well , excuse her for knowing what she wants to do with her life !
 i knew you were gonna throw that in my face ! ! that was three years ago ! she apologized and she apologized ! what more do you want ? ! !
so do we ! ! so do we ! !  i m sorry you had to see that .
my god !
well maybe she wouldn t have to be selfish in bed if someone else knew where everything was !
wh what s up ?
oh just say it kyle !
 y know , he hums when he pees !
it makes him miss the bowl , but whatever .
that s all right , we we don t need you . in fact , hey i m over it already .

a pigeon , a pigeon .  no , no wait , no no , an eagle flew in . landed on the stove and caught fire . the baby , seeing this , jumps across the apartment to the mighty bird s aid . the eagle , however , misconstrues as an act of aggression and grabs the baby on its talon . meanwhile the faucet fills the apartment with water . baby and bird still up lays  are locked in a death grip , swirling around the whirl pool , that fills the apartment .
great . so let s get going ?
somehow over time it got easier to be apart from you .

yeah , most of it it's a place packed with confused angry baseball fans !
yeah , uh , uh , ok , there's this great rare bookstore on madison avenue . you know what ? she loves architecture , you know what you should do ? you should take a walk down fifth to the saint patrick's cathedral and there there's this great little pastry shop that she'd love .
but i'm not !  . you know what if you're in the mood for thai food . . .
ok .
ok , when you walk in the museum , take the right , that's the antiquities wing . ancient egypt , mesopotamia , up to the byzantine empire .
now , do you have any idea what you just said ?
ok now , remember , when you get to the museum , monet is not spelt m o n a y . i just . . . i wrote that out phonetically for you .
yeah , yeah that means . . . you know ? we just . . . we don't have time for this .

 oh joey , joey ! but still , i mean , it seems like you guys are having a great time together .
what ?
what , i mean , a little , but no , what , go on .
 yeah . but you know what ? i think you should give joey a chance . i mean , he's a great guy , and sure he doesn't know that much about art but you know , you can always talk about that with someone else .
and if you think about it , i mean the reason he memorized all that stuff is because he thought it was important to you . you know , that's the kind of guy joey is .
that was going to be my next argument .
hey !
glad i could help man .
thank you .
boy , we uhm . . . hadn't really thought of that .
oh , come on rach , we will . i promise . we have more interviews  and worse comes to worse , we can always reconsider the uhm . . . the first one we met with .
she was blonde ?  just a sec . ! okay , okay . this one's name is sandy . she's got a degree in early childhood education , uhm . . . she worked for her last family for three years .
and she's a little mannish . . .
are you gay ? 
 so you're just like a . . . guy who's a nanny ?
 okay .
yeah , kids say all kinds of crap . 
oh , come on , rach , he's a guy !
because , it's weird !
what kind of job is that for a man ? a nanny ? i it's like if a woman wanted to be . . .
king ?
you gotta be at least bi . . .
 is everything allright ?
and i'm fine never having heard it . . .  rach , can i . . . can i see you for a sec ?
do you realise that man has cried in our apartment three times . . . ? huh ? i haven't cried that many times since i moved in .
 okay , okay , see . . . that . . . that is the problem . he is too sensitive . 
 yeah , i mean , all things that guy . . .  these are amazing !
this . . . this is exactly what i'm talking about . what kind of a guy makes . . . makes . . . delicate french cookies , huh ? they're not even . . . butch , manly cookies with . . . with . . . you know with . . . with chunks . 
hey . . . there's sensitive . . . and there is too sensitive .
did rachel tell you we hired a male nanny ?
oh really ? did she tell you he plays the recorder , recites poetry and bakes madeleines ?
 lighter than air . . .  but that's not the point . 
hey . . . ! rachel and i hired a male nanny .
thank you !
 .  a what ? a what ? what's the end of that sentence ?
wow !
science . . . ? academia . . . ? being a good father . . . ?
uhm . . . rachel and i hired a male nanny . 
hey . . . i made up that joke and told it to you !

really ? sounded like three blind mice .
 i swear to god . . . ! 
okay , okay . . . how exactly is a two month old supposed to appreciate puppets ?
 oh my god !
oh , i'm sorry . please apologise to sandy and the snufflebumps for me .
well , you know what . . . i i'm sorry i'm the only one who isn't in love with gary poppins out there . . . but i just . . . i can't . . . i can't go through with this .
no ! hey , you know what ? i'm sorry . i would never force you . . . to hire someone you were this uncomfortable with . . .
thank you !

i . . . just feel that the . . . the chemistry isn't right . i'm sorry . we're . . . we're more than happy to give you good recommendation . . .
anyway , uhm .  well , i'm glad there's no hard feelings .
no , you know , it's uhm . . . nothing you did , it's . . . it's uhm . . . my issue .
you know , i'm just not uhm . . . that comfortable with a guy who's as sensitive as you .
why . . . i . . . i don't know .  uhm . . . errrr . . . maybe . . . maybe because of my father ?
i mean , uhm . . . you know when i was growing up he was kind of a tough guy . . . you know a a and as a kid i wasn't the athlete i am now .
i play squash . . . ! anyway , uhm . . . i uhm . . . i always get the feeling he thought i was too sensitive .
it was hard . . . i remember . . . i was in my bedroom . . . playing with my dinosaurs . . . playing and learning . . . and my father walks in and says . . . he says . . . what are you doing with those things ? what's wrong with you , why aren't you . . . why aren't you outside playing like a . . . like a real boy ?
i know i am !   .  and when it's summer , and it's hot , why can't you wear a tank top ?

ross , this is not how we wanted you to find out about this . you have every right to go nuts .

feel me up ?
hey .
oh , you bet .
okay , well , we brought you some wine .

no awareness .
look , charlie , i just want you to know . ross is just having a little trouble adjusting to the thought of joey and me . you know , he normally doesn't drink like this .
ross , you don't even have oven mitts on !
ooy .
oh my god , are we supposed to answer ?
ross , you don't seem okay .
oh , that's okay , girls tend not to like me .
you know what , ross ? i think we're gonna take off too .

mon . . . okay . . . i've gotta . . . just say what it is i'm gonna say . . . none of the amazing things that have happened to me in the last ten years , would have happened if it wasn't for you . no one has been more like a sister to me . . .
 i wouldn't know what i'm gonna do without you . . .

i . . . i . . . i . . . 
 oh , i'm sure gonna miss pretending to laugh at your weird jokes that i don't get .

oh , you guys . this was an amazing night . thank you so much . i love you . good night .
what ?
ross . . .
you really think i didn't say goodbye to you because i don't care ?
i cannot believe that after ten years , you do not know one thing about me .
because it is too damn hard ross . i can't even begin to explain to you how much i'm gonna miss you . when i think about not seeing you every day , it makes me not want to go . . . okay , so if you think that i didn't say goodbye to you because you don't mean as much to me as everybody else , you're wrong . it's because you mean more to me . so there , all right , there's your goodbye . . . oh !
what ?
what ?
oh , let me see !  oh , god , is he just the sweetest thing ? you must just want to kiss him all over !

o okay !
hi .
ugh , horrible ! i did the stupidest , most embarrassing thing !

 all right , we were shaking hands and he kinda leaned toward me  y'know maybe he was going to open the door , but i totally miss read him and i uhhh  
well , i didn't know what else to do !
thanks chandler .
i can't believe it ! i got a second interview !
what what , wait a minute , you don't think that's why he wants me back ?
i accidentally kissed him in the interview , and now he wants me back y'know of course , 'cause let's bring the girl back who kisses everybody ! 
oh my god ! what if he thinks i'm the kind of girl that that would just sleep with him ?
maybe . i i don't know oh god , how could i be so stupid ? !
ohh , well i'm not totally back yet , but thank you .
hi !
thank you .
what ?
excuse me ?
 wh whoa ! all right , okay okay , i see , i see what's going on here ! now listen , look look , i'm sorry if i gave you the wrong impression , but i am not some hussy who will just sleep around to get ahead ! now even though i  , hey hey hey , even though i kissed you , that does not give you the right to demand sex from me . i do not want , this job that bad . good day , sir . 
 ugh , you will not believe what that sleaze ball from ralph lauren did too me !
okay okay that that's amazing . how did you know that ?
oh .  ohhhhhhhhh  .
ah , first , i i would like to say thank you for agreeing to see me again .
 okay . umm , well , first i would like to start by apologizing for kissing you and uh , for yelling at you .
now you're probably going to hire one of the people who did not ah ,  who did , who did not umm , yell at you and storm out , and i think that's a big mistake and here's why . i made a huge fool of myself and i came back , that shows courage . when i thought you wanted sex in exchange for this job , i said no . that shows integrity . and , i was not afraid to stand up for myself and that shows courage .  okay umm , now i know i already said courage , but y'know you gotta have courage . and umm , and finally when i thought you were making sexual advances in the workplace , i said no and i was not litigious . {by the way , litigious means to want to litigate and litigate is to make a lawsuit against .  so she didn't want to sue him .   don't worry , i had to look it up too . } so there you go , you got , you got  courage , you got integrity , you got  courage again , and not litigious . look mr 
zelner ! right ! i knew that ! i really , really want this job and i think , i think i would be really good at it .
 oh ! you are ?
really ? oh thank you ! oh  oh , would it be completely inappropriate to give you a hug ?
okay , well then how about a handshake ?  oh god i'm sorry ! oh god , i'm sorry ! i did not mean to touch that i mean you there . there . uhh , okay , so thank thank you , i'm going to leave now thank you very much uh huh , thank you so hey ! i'll see you monday ! 
 i cannot believe ross is buying this !
yeah ! oh by the way , thank you for loaning us pamela and yasmine .

i know ! it's like i'm being punished for not having this disgusting , poisoning habit !
i mean what if this keeps happening ? y'know , they'll they'll be outside smoking , making all the decisions and i'll just be up in my office breathing my stupid clean air , y'know ? and then when the day comes when kim wants to promote one of us , who do you think she's gonna pick ? me or smokey smokerson ?

and i mean , you know , you guys . . . this is a big deal . i mean , how can we have her first birthday party without her aunt and her uncle !
you know pheebs , when i was little , on my birthday , my daddy would hide a present in every room of the house , and then he would draw a treasure map to help me find 'em all .
oh , good , good ! we had this idea to make a birthday video for emma and we'll give it to her when she is 18 .
oh no , it's still nap time . but she'll be up soon .
i said it's still nap time .
hey joey , will you please set this up for people to put emma's presents on ?
oh , she's still napping
look , i know that you guys really want to get to vermont and this isn't a really big deal to you , but it really is to us , ok ? emma will never have a first birthday again .
no really , she didn't sleep well last night , so we can't wake her up .
oh ! emma might like what ?
what did you get her ?
well , this sounds like fun ! well , you know what ? actually ? people are getting a little antsy waiting emma to wake up from her nap , so would you mind performing them once now ?
 all right , let s get this party started , huh ? joey and phoebe are gonna perform a little something for us .
so , joey , what are you gonna do for us ?
oh , ok , which one ?
 wow ! that was amazing !
oh , phoebe , i m sorry ! phoebe has prepared something as well .
is that it ?
ross , um , don t forget to get a shot of emma s cake . it s in a box in the fridge .
oh , you're gonna love this cake . i got it from a bakery in new jersey , corino s .
well , anyway , they make these great novelty cakes , in all different shapes , and if you give them a photo , they ll copy it in icing !
yes ! on a cake shaped like a bunny .
ross , what are you talking about ?  oh ! oh my god ! they put my baby s face on a penis !
why you guys this isn't funny , all right ? if i wanted this cake to be a disaster i would have baked it myself !
oh ! believe you me ! i am going to bring this cake back , i don't even want it in my home . . .  joey , don't touch it ! !
 yes , yes . i still want my daughters picture , but on a bunny cake . yellow cake , chocolate frosting with nuts !

ooh ! god ! sorry !
emma's awake .
i can't believe this . this is her first birthday . she's awake . we're not even there . everybody left . we still have this stupid obscene cake .
oh , why do you even bother ? i already ruined her first birthday . . . and do you know how important these early experiences are ross ? very ! according to the back cover of that book that you gave me .
 i guess . . . oh , i just had such an idea of what this day would be like , you know ? emma laughing and everybody gathered around her cake singing happy birthday  . then we would all go into . . . hey get out of the road you stupid student driver ! ! !  they have to learn !
what ?
 oh my god ! look what . . . you made it into a bunny . how did you do that ?
well , i'm very impressed .
i don't care that you left . i'm just glad that you're here . thanks you guys !

her dancer friends ?

i dunno . y know to me he ll always be  jack geller , walks in while you re changing . 
 look at it , isn t it beautiful ?
it s a truffle . it s got all of these layers . first there s a layer of ladyfingers , then a layer of jam , then custard , which i made from scratch , [joey and ross make impressed faces ] then raspberries , more ladyfingers , then beef sauteed with peas and onions , [joey and ross look like something s wrong . ] then a little more custard , and then bananas , and then i just put some whipped cream on top !
the beef ? yeah , that was weird to me , too . but then , y know , i thought  well , there s mincemeat pie ,  i mean that s an english dessert , these people just put very strange things in their food , y know . [to joey ] oh ! by the way , can i borrow some rum from your place ?
 and while i m gone don t you boys sneak a taste .
joey , god , your apartment is like a hundred degrees !
no !
yeah ?
 no , i did , but tell me again , because it s so romantic .
joey ! come on ! i don t wanna make any mistakes , alright ? this is the only dessert and if i screw it up everybody's gonna be like  oh , remember that thanksgiving when rachel screwed up the trifle ? 
so why don t you just let me worry about making the trifle and you just worry about eating it , alright ?
okay . . .
what s up , ross ?
yeah !
oh no . no ross , don t do this .
i just   i don t think us getting back together is a good idea .
i thought this might happen today . ross , i know the holidays can be rough . y know ? and it s probably really hard for you to be alone right now .
no , i i live with phoebe . i mean you re [pity tone ] alone , alone . and i just it s just not the time for us . i m sorry .
joey , you re gonna have to stop rushing me , you know what ? you don t get any dessert .
no , i m just kidding i would never do that to you ! okay , everybody , it s trifle time !

beef .
alright , monica , i want you to have the first taste .
oh oh oh , wait ! you only got whipped cream in there ! ya gotta take a bite with all the layers !
op ! wait , you dropped a pea .
well ?
really ? how good ?
okay , now what was that all about ? is it does it not taste good ? let me try it .
 .  so a bird just grabbed it , and then tried to fly away with it and , and then just dropped it on the street ?
oh , phoebe , do i wanna hear this ?
 oh my god , he dream cheated on you !
 i wasn t supposed to put beef in the trifle !

oh my god , honey , i'm so sorry !
really ?
oh my god ! oh my god , look at these pelts !
what ? uhh , phoebe , honey , honey , i know you're quirky and i get a big kick out of it , we all do actually , but if you destroy a coat like this that is like a crime against nature ! not nature , fashion !

you know , ross , just keep making your jokes . how are you gonna feel if we actually do win ?
oh , i know , i know , the odds are against us , but somebody has to win , and it could be us ! and then how you gonna feel ? you know , we're gonna be all like oh everybody , let's take our helicopters up to the cape  and you're gonna be all like oh , i can't guys , i'll meet you guys up there , i gotta gas up the hyundai 
i don't really care about the knicks .
 you would do that ? i never get picked !
i'm hoping that if she hears it enough it will be her first word .
ooh , you guys , it starts in like 20 minutes .
ooh , i have another idea !
well , well , well , look what mommy found ! !

 oh ! alright , you know what ? that's it ! i want my share of the tickets  !
ok , that's it ! just give'em to me ! i'll split them up ! 
oh , if she jumps , i get her tickets .
oh , it is so unfair . it's like that time they promoted sandra over me at work .

when a guy breaks up with his girlfriend , what is an appropriate amount of time to wait before you make a move ?
interesting .
huh . a moo point ?
 have i been living with him for too long , or did that all just make sense ?
you're right , i'm sorry . thank you . okay , that's what i'm gonna do .
hey !
how are you holding up ?
yeah ? i'm sorry about your girlfriend .
so were you guys together a long time ?
now that she broke up with you ?
yeah . hmmmm .
no yeah , all the time , constantly . it's terrifying . but you know that i figure it it has to work out .
because , uh it has to .
yeah , i know , i do . i really do .
well , what is a boss for ? hug it out ! 
uh , yeah , well , see , he  joey knows , that i'm i'm very insecure about my back and , and you're hugging me , so obviously you are not repulsed by it , yeah !
no ?  all right , here's the truth um , joey said what he said , because um , i'm attracted to you .
yeah , i admit it . i have a crush on you , and uh , and , and i know that's crazy because we work together , and and nothing could ever happen , and the last thing i want to do is is to freak you out or make you feel uncomfortable . which is why it would be really great if you said something right about now .
what ?
okay , that's gonna take them a minute . do you have anything else you wanna get off your chest ?
 wait , we still have time to talk and they re they're not even in the car yet !  oh look , there they go , okay . 
yeah , ohh ! why , damnit , why did i open my mouth ?  i have a crush on you ; i am attracted to you .  gee , i i know that i freaked him out
 hi !
 hi !
oh , hi ! how are you doing ?
oh .
look , um , i think we should talk about what happened on the terrace .
ah , i i never should have said what i said . it y know what ? it just doesn't matter how i feel . i mean we work together , so nothing could really ever happen between us , and what i would love is just to go to work on monday , and and never talk about this again , okay ? big day monday lots to do . so , we're okay ?
oh , god , i know it , that i freaked you out .
really ?
okay , well , that's one less thing we have to do on monday .
 uhh , we still need a tip .
a couple of bucks .
phoebe , i bet somebody's missing that badge .
hey joey !

y'know honey , umm , as uh , as flattered as i am that uh , you saw me first , uhh , i just , i i don't think we should be cranking anything up .
 yeah , well , y'know umm  no honey , listen i think it's a great idea to become friends with someone before you date them , but i think the way you do it is y'know you meet someone , become their friend , build a foundation , then you ask them out on a date . don't hit on your existing friends !
yeah . yeah . oh , but once you find it , ohh it's so worth the wait .
 hey ross ! i brought reinforcements .

i just never had a relationship with that kind of passion , you know , where you have to have somebody right there , in the middle of a theme park .
there , well , see ? barry wouldn't even kiss me on a miniature golf course .
no , he said we were holding up the people behind us .
i mean , do you think there are people who go through life never having that kind of . . .

i have absolutely no idea .
 oh my god , you guys , what am i doing ? what am i doing ? this is so un me !
god , the first time he smiled at me . . . those three seconds were more exciting than three weeks in bermuda with barry .
y'know , i know it's totally superficial and we have absolutely nothing in common , and we don't even speak the same language but goooooooddddddd . . . .
how was the honeymoon ?
oh !
i did not know you spoke french .

 ow . i don't want him to wake up alone ! i should go to the hospital !

really , i shouldn't feel guilty ?
ok , maybe you're right .
wait , wait , wait , wait . would you stay here with me for a little while ?
ok .  thank you for coming with me today .
rachel green is very happy you're in her room !

taking advantage ? i'm giving you the advantage , enjoy !
wow . ok .
mhm mh !

hmm hmm . 
 yep .
fyi . .
in the future , when a girl asks for some ill advised sympathy sex . . . just do it . 
 really ? well , it seems to me if you'd done the right thing , i would not have woken up today feeling stupid and embarrassed , i would have woken up feeling comforted and satisfied !
oh stop that !
 oh , that is so hot . she walks around him to the other side )
oh , really , well ross , you know what ? i am a big girl . i don't need someone telling me what is best for me .
oh , really , really ? well , it wasn't very good for me either . 
what ?
oh , good .
okay . . . hey listen , just before you go i i again , i just wanna say thank you  for coming with me .
and also , you know i uh , i was thinking about what you said , you know , about the whole sex thing and . . . it's probably not a great idea to go down that road again .
it's a shame though , i mean , when we did it , it was pretty good .
hey uhm , do you remember that one really great time . . . ?
you know it was you're uhm . . . birthday . . .
well , i guess that's all in the past , now .
 not even one more time ?
no matter how much we want it .
that's what we decided .
 .  it's kinda hard though !
you know , when two people have a connection , you know , that's . . . just seems like such a . . . waste .
 .  ross ?
just so you know . . . with us . . . it's never off the table . 
oh my god , who is it ? ! 
for you . 
oh , thank you for doing that . i just can t deal with this just quite yet .

i don t know ! maybe they have tools .

ah , it s still not the time .
ohh , are you setting ross up with someone ? does she have a wedding dress ?
hey .
yeah .
well , sure , but they might think it s kinda weird considering i don t work there anymore .
i i , got a job at ralph lauren .
yeah .  a year ago . .
but , pheebs , you can still use the copy machine where i actually work . but , just come by at lunch so my boss doesn t see you . cause kim will just freak out and she already doesn t like me very much .
sure .
oh my god . did you talk to him ?
what ? what ! ? ! you kissed him ?
 phoebe are you serious ?
phoebe , i mean , you do know he s married ?
phoebe 
oh , kim , hi . 
so you know , i i handed in that marketing report and i never got to hear what you thought .
ahh .so wow the spring line , it s really going to be great this year , huh ?
so i hear the ralph lauren fooled around with someone in the copy room . 
yeah . your teeth ? yes , i saw them from outside .  you guys are never going to believe this . but , phoebe made out with ralph lauren .
yeah i know . she ran into him at my office and they just made out . and the craziest thing is , now my boss likes me because i told her about it and she said it was the best gossip she d heard all year .
that that is your make out buddy . don t you recognize him ?  oh wait . ohh , phoebe i love you . kiss me please .
what ?
oh my god , phoebe , that s not ralph lauren . that s kenny the copy guy .
oh  go  oh  and i told my boss that someone made out with ralph lauren . if she finds out that i lied to her , she is going to hate me even more . phoebe ! !
to get you to make out with him ! ! !
ohh , hi , kim .
yeah , remember that thing i told you that happened yesterday ? well it didn t happen .
okay , two things didn t happen . remember i told you that someone made out with ralph lauren in the copy room ? well , it turns out that s not true .
no .
oh no , no , no . oh god , you think i made out with him .
i i don t want your job . i i don t . ohh this is such a mistake . i did not make out with him . nobody made out with him . i did not use my keycard yesterday . i don t even know how to use my keycard . 
now , she thinks that i made out with him and i did it to get her job .
i did but she doesn t think anyone would be stupid enough to confuse kenny the copy guy with ralph lauren .
you were with kenny today , weren t you ?
ohh , phoebe , what am i going to do ?
i m not going to sleep with ralph lauren . i mean , i could , but i wouldn t .
that wouldn t help me .
kim , hi .
okay  okay . . look . i m sorry that i lied to you before . you were right . ralph and i were an item but were not anymore .
 yeah , he dumped me . he said , rachel , i can t do this . even though you are a very , very , very beautiful women . i can t do this . i m married and i m sorry .  and then i don t know why but he said , and you will never get promoted . especially not above kim , who is an integral cog in the ralph lauren machine . 
of course it s true and it hurts so bad .
you and ralph ?
everything you need to know is in that first kiss .
yeah , well , word of advice : bring back the comedian . otherwise next time you're gonna find yourself sitting at home , listening to that album alone .
has anybody seen my engagement ring ?
oh god , oh god , oh god oh god oh god oh god . . . . 
oh , like i wasn't dreading tomorrow enough , having to give it back to him . . . 'hi barry ! remember me ? i'm the girl in the veil who stomped on your heart in front of your entire family ! ' oh god and now i'm gonna have to return the ring , without the ring , which makes it so much harder . . .
i know i had it this morning , and i know i had it when i was in the kitchen with . . .

oh god  oh , he s in there right now ?
uh , let s rip !

now , if you will excuse me i am going to go and lie down . 
oh god monica hi ! thank god ! i just went to your building and you weren't there and then this guy with a big hammer said you might be here and you are , you are !
hi , sure !
oh god . . . well , it started about a half hour before the wedding . i was in the room where we were keeping all the presents , and i was looking at this gravy boat . this really gorgeous lamauge gravy boat . when all of a sudden   sweet 'n ' lo ?   i realized that i was more turned on by this gravy boat than by barry ! and then i got really freaked out , and that's when it hit me : how much barry looks like mr . potato head . y'know , i mean , i always knew looked familiar , but . . . anyway , i just had to get out of there , and i started wondering 'why am i doing this , and who am i doing this for ? ' .  so anyway i just didn't know where to go , and i know that you and i have kinda drifted apart , but you're the only person i knew who lived here in the city .
ooh , i was kinda hoping that wouldn't be an issue . . . [scene : monica's apartment , everyone is there and watching a spanish soap on tv and are trying to figure out what is going on . ]
 daddy , i just . . . i can't marry him ! i'm sorry . i just don't love him . well , it matters to me !
c'mon daddy , listen to me ! it's like , it's like , all of my life , everyone has always told me , 'you're a shoe ! you're a shoe , you're a shoe , you're a shoe ! ' . and today i just stopped and i said , 'what if i don't wanna be a shoe ? what if i wanna be a   a purse , y'know ? or a   or a hat ! no , i'm not saying i want you to buy me a hat , i'm saying i am a ha   it's a metaphor , daddy !
look daddy , it's my life . well maybe i'll just stay here with monica .
well , maybe that's my decision . well , maybe i don't need your money . wait ! ! wait , i said maybe ! !
i'm all better now .
please , no , go , that'd be fine !
well , i was kinda supposed to be headed for aruba on my honeymoon , so nothing !
well actually thanks , but i think i'm just gonna hang out here tonight .  it's been kinda a long day .
barry , i'm sorry . . . i am so sorry . . . i know you probably think that this is all about what i said the other day about you making love with your socks on , but it isn't . . . it isn't , it's about me , and i ju    hi , machine cut me off again . . . anyway .  look , look , i know that some girl is going to be incredibly lucky to become mrs . barry finkel , but it isn't me , it's not me .  and not that i have any idea who me is right now , but you just have to give me a chance too . . . 
oh .  see . . . but joanne loved chachi ! that's the difference !
isn't this amazing ? i mean , i have never made coffee before in my entire life .
y'know , i figure if i can make coffee , there isn't anything i can't do .

ross , that girl just spent the entire evening talking to your friends , asking to hear stories about you , looking through monica s photo albums , i mean you don t do that if you re just in it for two weeks .

bye !
hey !
you guys aren't doing anything tonight , are you ?
i was just asking 'cause i need someone to watch emma tonight .
well , phoebe set me up on a date .

what , slept together a year and a half ago ? yeah , i'm all set .
so i'll bring her by around seven ? is that okay ?
oh , you guys are gonna have so much fun ! she's at such a cute age . oh , a couple things . now that she's eating solid food , she poops around the clock . and watch out for your hair , 'cause she likes to grab it . and oh , she's also in this phase where if you leave the room , she screams bloody murder , but ah . . . thanks , you guys . have fun !
wow , everything looks so good ! i think i'm gonna have the chicken .
oh , well , that's    that's very sweet . thank you .
what ?
well , come on , steve ; let's not rule out nervous laughter . hey , now wait a minute . phoebe told me that    that you owned your own restaurant . that's impressive .
really ? what's that like ?
really ?
phoebe , it's me . i'm going to hunt you down and kill you !
this is the worst date ever . how could you set me up with this creep ?
i don't care ! this guy is a nightmare !
he's not stoned .
yeah , four times .

oh , well , i .  it's kind of weird talking to you about this , but . . .
yeah .
oh .
oh , oh no . do you think she walked in , saw you and left ?
well , if it makes you feel any better , i wish my date hadn't shown up .
well , he makes t shirts for a living , and he thought it would be appropriate to give me this .
oh . huh . you know , it is weird that phoebe would set me up on a date that was awful on the same night that joey set you up on a date that didn't even show .
 hi , guys !
what's going on ?
oh okay , hey guys , would you flip mine too ?
 oh look ! a letter from my mom .
oh yeah ! i know .
 oh my god ! my dog died !
oh my god , le poo , our dog !
oh god , it says he was hit by an ice cream truck and dragged for nine   teen blocks . oh .  oh my god .
it's le poo .
oh yeah ! 
what ?
oh god .  no ! oh not again !  this this happened when my grandfather died . it's ugh ! sorry .  oh , okay , so i'm sorry , what what were you what did you want to tell me ?
sorry . sorry .
yeah , i know . it's ridiculous ! i can't see you either .
hi !
okay , what's up ?
yeah , i told you to give emily whatever she wants .
yeah ?
that's crazy ! you can't do that ! what are you going to tell her ?   oh god . ohh , you already agreed to this , haven't you ?
ohh ! lucky me ! oh my god ! that is good news , ross ! i think that's the best news i've heard since le poo died !
oh yeah , really ? is it ross ? yeah ? okay , well let me make this a just a little bit easier for you .
storming out !
yeah , well that's how mad i am ! !
 hi !
look , i know you guys heard about the whole thing with me and ross but y'know , i've been obsessing about it all day and i'd just love not to talk about it . all right ?
that's not ross !
oh my god , its happening . it's already started . i'm kip .
 do you even know who kip is ?
see ? yeah , you told me the story . he and monica dated when they broke up they couldn't even be in the same room together and you all promised that you would stay his friend and what happened ? he got phased out !
well , of course i am ! it's not gonna happen to ross ! he's your brother .  he's your old college roommate . ugh , it was just a matter of time before someone had to leave the group . i just always assumed phoebe would be the one to go .
honey , come on ! you live far away ! you're not related . you lift right out .
phoebe ?  i'm sorry about the whole lifting out thing .  you gotta come with me !
wherever i go . come on you and me , we'll we'll start a new group , we're the best ones .
hi . what are you doing here ? isn't this against the rules ?
oh , ross 
no , it's not better . i still don't get to see you .
well , for starters i would've said the right name at my wedding !
i know .
i know that too .
yeah , it's in there . 
uh huh !
noo way , kevin .
ross , you are so pathetic . why can't your son just play with his doll ? 
what's the big deal ? why don't you wanna see janice ?
men are unbelievable .
amazingly , that makes sense .
sure pheebs , you know , that's what it's there for , emergencies and pretend agents .
very nice touch .
unbelievable .
honey , this will help . 
okay , wait a minute , wait a minute , wait a minute . maybe it's not so bad . how did you leave it ?
yeah , well that's that lo cal , non dairy , soy milk junk . we sort of , we save the real stuff for those really terminal cases .
yeah , you do .
this is a very critical time right now . if you feel yourself reaching for that phone , then you go shoe shopping , you get your butt in a bubble bath . you want her back you have to start acting aloof .
right . so , what you have to do is , you have to accidentally run into her on purpose . and then act aloof .
oooh , honey , you're not a total loser .
oh .
g.i . joe ? do you really think he's gonna fall for that ?
yeah , it is .
shhh .  i don't know what to do , this is totally unprecedented .
yeah .
yes , and grumpy .
he's soo lucky , if janice were a guy , she'd be sleeping with somebody else by now .
here you go pheebs . who else wants one of my special homemade brownies ?
phoebe , what ? umm .  what ? !
and all these people actually died ?
phoebe , your in pain , would you just go to the dentist , just go .
i promise .
joey , you can t keep this to yourself , if you know about this , you have to tell him .
whoa ! wait ! hello ! what about me ?
 look benny , spoon .  spoon . come on ! all right , y'know what i think he s bored .
okay . okay honey , he s fine , he s fine , let s just put him down . come here , ben .  see that s a good boy .  how could you do that to him ! ! ross trusted me , what is he going to say ? !
we re not ? !

uh huh .
 look at that !  look at that !  we all do it .  okay , i m stopping now .

well uh , his answering machine was very understanding . ugh . i feel blue .
yeah , maybe , but i don t think i even care . i don t think he s the one i m sad about . y know , i know that i said that i am totally okay with ross getting married , but as it turns out , i don t think i m handling it all that well .
and i i am just trying to figure out why .
well , yeah , y know how ross and i were on again , off again , on again , off again ? i guess i just figured that somewhere down the road , we would be on again .
yeah , well , you uh , better make it for three .
three people . joshua s not gonna be there .
uh , well , i think , i think he broke up with me .
well , apparently he scares easy .
it s okay . sometimes , things don t work out the way you d thought they would .
 oh , hey , don t you have to go pick up emily ?
yeah .
yeah ! i got my girls .
ugh .

okay , you guys , just relax .  i doooo . 
oh , wait , joshua ! joshua !   yeah , well , that oughta do it .
i cannot believe that you didn t tell me that we are still married ! !

so , i still have boxes here . i still have boxes at ross s , and i have nowhere to live ! wow . i could so easily freak out right now .
well , maybe maybe i could be your roommate pheebs .
well there s an idea ! !
that would be great ! wait , how long is denise gone for ?
december 26th , huh maybe she s santa clause .
 oh look who it is , my husband . the apple of my eye .
well sure , if you say you re gonna take care of everything i have no reason to doubt you . give me those forms !  all right , now i m gonna do this my way and i don t want to hear a peep out of you !
op ! you re peeping !
ross ! y know what , i just got why ? why did you do this ? !
i don t wanna hear three failed marriages ! 
well , y know what ? thanks to you i m half way there ! ugh ! oh ! i am so mad ! ross , i don t think i have ever been this angry !

uh yes , heroin and crack .
well , you would know .
 ross , please , i found the magazines !
ugh !
ross ! your honor , rest assured relationship ended like two years ago !  and could you strike consummated like bunnies  from the record ?
well , yes , we got married in vegas and uh , and the names i think .
 what ? ! me ? ! what about you and your consummated like bunnies nonsense !
 okay , do you see , do you see what you re keeping me married too ? !
all right look lady here is the deal , i came here for an annulment and i am not leaving here until i get one !
and thank you for your time . 
this is totally your fault !

don t call us that ! 
 oh honey thank god you re home , i was getting worried .
oh , little  x s ! great ! that makes up for everything !
oh , name one stupid thing that is as stupid as this one !
hey ! wait a minute ! that was different ! i did those things because i was in love with you !
nothing . 
uh hmm . 
okay ross , we re wait a minute . umm , i uh , i kinda have a little confession .
well , y know this whole marriage thing , kinda my idea .
well , remember how we were too drunk to remember anything the night we were married ?
and uh , yeah , i didn t really , i didn t want to say anything , but it kinda it just , it kinda kept coming back to me , and umm , remember we were in the casino and for some reason thought it would be funny to eat a lot of grapes . and uh , and i thought it would be funnier if we got married . so as a , as a compromise we decided first to get married , and then  to eat a lot of grapes . so umm , sorry i got us into this mess .
yeah , don t push it though .
i know . i always thought if you and i got married , it would be the one that stuck . and it wouldn t be a secret , and we wouldn t have our wedding dinner at pizza hut . 
no , it was on the house , it was , it was a newlywed special .
hey , thanks ross , for taking care of all of this .
i m gonna need a copy of those .
yeah , so what is she , like a . . . like a spokesmodel , or an aerobics instructor , what ?
well maybe she and her friends are just having a contest to see who can bring home the biggest geek .
oh , the velveteen rabbit ! oh my god , when the boy's love makes the rabbit real !
huh . well , then you'd better keep it away from ross's hair . so this is pretty rare . how did you get that ?
oh , honey , that's so sweet .
oh my god ! what happened ?
yes , you have to get her something , and it should be something really nice .
and not one of your coupons for an hour of joey love . 
no ! i'm sorry , honey , it's just that last week i got all but three answers and i really want to finish a whole one without any help .
hey , how'd it go ?
you know what we should all do ? go see a musical .
and you know which one we should see ? the 1996 tony award winner . do you happen to know the name of that one ?
no . . . .
yes ! rent !
what ? oh , i'm sorry , i can't , i'm busy .
what did you get her ? 
okay , honey , what he means by that , is  .  while this is a very nice gift , maybe it's just not something a boyfriend gives ?
any luck ?
all right , look . why don't you just return the book , let joey give her the clock pen , and you give her something worse than that . like . . . a regular pen .
aw , honey , that's so sweet .
oh ! pathetic ! 
i did it ! oh ! i finished it ! i did it all by myself ! and there's nobody to hug !
hey ! hey , you guys , i finished the crossword all by myself ! hug me !
thanks !
thank you ! hey , how'd the catering go ?

okay , pheebs , i was hoping for more of a change .

i know , i mean , why can't parents just stay parents ?  why do they have to become people ? why do they have . . .  why can't you stop staring at my breasts ?
did you not get a good enough look the other day ?
c'mon , he's right . tit for tat .
you're right ! i mean you're right ! it wasn't just the weebles , but it was the weeble play palace , and and the weebles ' cruise ship . oh , which had this little lifeboat for the weebles to wobble in .

well , i used to date him , but you re still going out with her !
yeah , but she also invited you and ross . yeah , honey , i m sorry , but i don t think that was a romantic thing .
well , that s a lot better than ross trying to kiss me in high school , and saying that he did it because he needed chapstick .

we are looking for our christmas presents from monica .
don t worry , we re just gonna search here for an hour , them we re gonna go over to joey s and search , ok ?

oh my god ! that's the creepiest thing i've ever heard !
oh ! phoebe , all babies are beautiful !
phoebe , just the idea of pitting one baby against another , i mean , you know , and judging who's cuter just for a trophy . . .
and a thousand dollars .
 .  is something i'm very interested in ! oh please , do not tell ross . he still believes that  what's in the inside is important . . .

oh , take the clothes of joey's cabbage patch kid .
oh phoebe , listen . well , i think we gotta go . this place is really freaking me out . i've been watching this guy over there , i don't think he came with a kid !

oh ! 
 okay ! okay ! listen to what sean mcmahon wrote in my yearbook senior year , dear rach , you re such a good person .  not girl ! person !

ohh , there s a picture of her in the yearbook actually .
wh phoebe ! !
all right , y know fine ! you guys have your stupid little club , but i would just like to say is what you did to me is way worse than what i did to you ! you gave me a tiney wienie ! 
wow 
she s right .
you can keep those pants by the way .
hey .
well , y know i was thinking of moving the couch over here .
so that there will be a decent place for me to sit .
and your lap does not count ! okay ? come on help me move this .
no ?
i m sorry , rosita ? as in 
joey , it s just a chair ! what s the big deal ?
stevie the tv ?

joey , joey i am so sorry .
okay , come on joey , i ll buy you a new one ! all right ? we ll go down to the store right now and we ll we ll get you a new chair .
but don t you think rosita would ve wanted you to move on ? i mean y know , she did always put your comfort first .
 okay ? you ready ?
you will like it !
you don t even know !
well look , if you don t like this 
come on joey , i just bought you a new chair ! the most expensive one in the store ! hey , y know what i was thinking ? we could name her francette .
joey , the new chair will be here in an hour . maybe we should actually move rosita out of here . y know , start the heeling process ?
that s weird .
it s not a miracle joey ! i m sure there s some explanation .
joey , i really don t 
well no .
no , y know what ? maybe somebody came in here and fixed it ! or something !
that s right joey , the chair angel came in and heeled your chair . 
 i am so psyched i kept this chair for myself !
hey , how s how s the uh , miracle chair ?
yeah ? wow ! y know , that this thing has speakers in the headrest !
yeah ! you can hook it up to your tv and you get radio !
hey chandler !
how would you like to sit in a chair that fully reclines , has a rolling massage , and speakers in the head rest ?
well what if i told you , you can do it in my apartment ?
i just purchased the la z boy e cliner 3000 . 
well , it s a long story , but umm i broke joey s chair 
yeah .
ohhhhh . that s how it got fixed !
noo !  angels .
what ? wh hey !

no joe , no miracle .
uh huh ! nice try , but you don t get that chair anymore ! all right ? that is my chair now ! you can sit on my lap !  no i take that back !
no no no ! this chair s not going anywhere .
the logic is , that there are two of us and we are both strong enough to break a chair in half !
we re the cobras !
ahhhh  .
uh huh .
hey !
oh yeah , joey broke it . had to get rid of it .
all right , y know what , come on , do we really have to watch this while we eat ?

monica ! i couldn t find him for two hours ! he was having sex with amy welch !
i mean why , of all people would you want to go out with chip ? !
okay , that doesn t help me , because we went to the same high school .
 they had to have that specially made ? !

oh , you go out with him . 
yeah . just , if it s possible , could you leave him somewhere and go have sex with another guy ?
i believe it .

so honey , what are you gonna do about the little girl ?
i ll go with you .

well , can i keep the presents and still be 29 ?
y know , i m still 29 in guam .
late thirties ? oh come on you guys ! is it just me ? am i overreacting to this ?
look , y know i know my life s going pretty well , but i look around and i just see so many people who ve accomplished so many other goals by the time they re thirty .
there you go !
thirty . ugh , i mean thirty ! monica , do you remember mean , old mrs . kreeger in the fifth grade ? she was thirty !
nothing . i don t want to do anything .
really ! god ross , what were you thinking ?  i know it s really shallow , but a part of me wants him again .
y know what ? i am going to do something today . i m not just gonna sit around like some old lady . i m gonna get something pierced . like my uh , like my nose or my tongue or something .
so what ? ! y know what ? the way i see it ow ! son of a bitch ! !
 get out , get out of my apartment .
 hey ! everybody hide ! hide ! i saw her ! she s coming !
what s what s going on ? phil s really pissed !
okay , but taking care of a drunk , naked woman seems like a job for joey .
ahh !
 a scooter ! 
no ! no no , i love it . thank you . 
okay .
okay .  happy birthday grandma ! it s better to be over the hill  then buried under it .  all our love monica and chandler .  that s funny , yeah !
 no , i know ! i get it ! it s funny !
no i know , because to be a grandmother you have to be married and have children and i don t have any of those things . that s why it s so funny . 
well , i feel fine , but i think you re bumming out the rest of the kids .
okay ! y know what ? i realized it was stupid to get upset about not having a husband and kids . all i really needed was a plan . see i wanna have three kids 
as i was saying  i should probably have the first of the three kids by the time i m 35 which gives me five years . i love this plan ! i wanna marry this plan !
so , if i wanna have my kid when i m 35 , i don t have to get pregnant until i m 34 . which gives prada four years to start making maternity clothes ! oh wait , but i do want to be married for a year before i get pregnant 
no , so i don t have to get married until i m 33 ! that s three years , that s three whole years oh , wait a minute though . i ll need a year and a half to plan the wedding , and i d like to know the guy for a year , year and a half before we get engaged  which means i need to meet the guy by the time i m thirty .
no ! ross , no ! it is not fine ! eh eh according to my plan i should already be with the guy i wanna marry !
 i m telling you it s like watching bambi learn how to walk .
hey .  oh , poor pheebs .
ross , i really don t think 
hey joey , can i 
actually , i just wanna talk to tag .
whatever ! okay , i m not your mother .
not in the street ! !
 hi .
hey .
yeah , i m doing okay . i m um let s talk .
umm 
ohh tag , umm you re such a great guy and we have sooo much fun together but i don t i don t 
well said . and a uh good example of the fun i was referring to uhh , but i just think i m past the point where i think i can y know , just have fun .
yeah , it is ! but you re just a kid ! i mean you re 25 !
oh god ! y know what i wish ? i wish you were six years older . well actually , if i m wishin  for stuff , i actually wish i was six years younger .
yeah , i m sorry . 
oh , if i only want two kids , can i keep him for another year ?
shhh don't say that loud , gunther's gonna want to hug me .
ok , you know what , i'm just gonna take her outside .
ok , thank you .
oh , wow , molly is just great !
what ? you really think she's hot ?
and joey ?
am i the only one who doesn't think that she's hot ? ross ?
thank you ! 
so hot i cried myself to sleep last night . 
hello .
gavin , i just wanted to say thank you again for watching emma yesterday during the presentation . i really owe you an appology .
well , when we first met , you know , i thought you were pompous and arrogant and obnoxious  . . .
no , i just mean that , you know , first impressions don't mean anything . and i i think you're a really good guy and i'm sorry that i misjudged you .
hello .  but you know what , hey , new day , new leaf , i am just really really happy  . . .  i'm sorry , obviously heather's ass has something more important to say so i'll just wait 'till it's finished .
i was giving you an appology and you were totally checking her out !
oh wow , you are really , you're really a creep .
oh yeah , i'm jealous . oh gavin , please , please look at my ass  .  stop looking at my ass ! i mean , i just think you are totally inappropriate , ok ? this is a work environment , she's your subordinate .
that is totally different for two reasons . one    i didn't know that you knew that . and two , i wasn't some creep staring at his ass , we had a deap meaningful relationship .
it was  . . .  oh my god . he didn't have a last name . it was just tag  . you know , like cher , or , you know , moses .
oh , you know what    my first impression of you was absolutely right . you are arrogant , you are pompous  . . . morgan ! morgan ! tag's last name was morgan ! huh !
yeah well what are you , his boyfriend ?
 hey , listen , joey , about molly , i really prefer if you didn't go after her .
because it took us months to find a good nanny and i wouldn't want anything to , you know , drive her away .
rachel green's office ! ! give me that phone !  hello , this is rachel green , how can i help you ? uh huh  . . . ok then  . . . i'll pass you back to your son 
um , excuse me gavin , i have a question i need to ask you .
if you like looking at butts so much why don't you just go look at a mirror ?
oh , please , i don't care about you enough to bug me . in fact , from now on , i'm going take the high road . and i'm going be very very nice to you , you momma's boy  , starting right now .
hi !
yeah i am , i am ! oh , but first of all , monica , i would like to introduce you to my very talented colleage and more importantly my wonderful friend gavin mitchelle .
oh no no no no no , gavin can't , he already has plans , most likely with his mother .
why did you invite him ? ? i can't stand that guy !
i was faking it ! can't you tell when i'm being fake ?
hey , mr philips , nice suit !
shh !
 i still can't believe you invited gavin . allright , he is the last person i want to see .
god , i hope he doesn't show up . of course he's not gonna show up , the guy hates me .

how do you know about that ?
oh , that s what this is all about ? did you bring her up here to get back at me ?
score .
oh god , i can t believe you re making such a big deal about this . it was one kiss , one guy , one time !
yeah .
oh yeah .
what ? who ?
whoa , how do you know about that ?
why didn t i get that message ?
from the guy in the bar , why didn t i get that message ?
ross ?
why ?
oh god . you know what ? who you think you are ? who are you to decide what messages i should or should not get ?
yes .
oh my god , i cannot believe this . you know i actually came in here hoping to have a mature conversation with you
oh , ross , this is just so messed up ! what s wrong with us ? you know when people hear about our situation they
and you know , we said that we would , we would live together as long as this makes sense . an maybe this , you know ,
hi . can emma and i live here for a while ?
thank you .
 hey , what's what's going on ? !
awww , no , it's okay , we've actually known for a while .
well , ross , we were worried about you . we didn't know how you were going to react .
oh ! oh , i just thought of the greatest wedding gift to get you .
okay .
she is so cute ! you could fit her right in your little pocket !
aww , joey , come here .  look honey , i know this must be really , really difficult for you and i   oh , i'm sorry . am i hurting you ?
hmm . look , ross , if you want your neighbors to like you , why don't you just pay the hundred bucks ? the party's gonna cost you way more than that .
okay , i thought it was about your neighbors liking you .
and that crazy party animal will be your brother in law .
umm , chandler , you do realize that those ideas are probably already in monica's head .
well , because she loves you and because you love her .
hey , chandler , don't freak out ! i'm telling you something you already know ! come on , she broke up with richard because he didn't want to have babies . and she's a woman , and she's almost 30 , and y'know it's monica .
no , you're right , you are absolutely right . i mean that makes , that makes everything different .
not unless different means the same .
hi ! wow ! you look , you look big .
uhhh , yeah . but it's not obvious why .
hey ! hey , cute jacket !
oh ! ow ! 
whoa !  y'know what katie ? i gotta tell ya i i i i think you are the one who is too much . 
ohh , and the nicest girlfriend ! 
ohh , you're so sweet ! 
ohhhh , i cannot look at it ! 
oh no wait pheebs , i think for something like that you just ask them to move in with you . but i'm not sure , chandler ?
i am so proud of joey , i can't believe he's going to be on law  & order !
no because first they arrest the guy and then they try him .
what's going on ?
ross ! we broke up two years ago ; you've been married since then . i think it's okay that we see other people .
hm mmm .
okay , y'know what ? we don't need her measurements .
big night !
oh , umm , okay , yeah , i'll be , yeah i'll be right back . 
 here you go . thank you !
oh what , you you want both of them ?
okay , okay , okay , look , just don't freak out , but i kinda lost it . i know it's in the apartment , but i definitely lost it .
tell her to wear her own earrings .
nooo ! nooooo ! you lent me monica's earrings ? ! i'm not allowed to borrow her stuff !
because i lose her stuff !
oh boy , i just can't watch . it's too scary !
oh yeah well , you know me , babies , responsibilities , ahhh ! ! !
uhh , no , no , it bothered me when he slept with other women .
but y'know , i never really had anything to worry about . ross was never very good at the flirting thing .
oh ! y'know what ? you're right ! we meet , you flirted and then bamn nine years later you had me !
ohh ! thank god ! where was it ?
okay that is the one we already have !
 what ? !
 yeah .
 joey , why don't you just tell her what happened ? it's not your fault .
it's not here pheebs , it's not here . ohh , i went to joey and chandler's last night ! okay ! 
wait a minute . chandler has a jewelry box ?
   hey !
the earring ? no . but look , i found my sunglasses under the couch ! i've been looking for these since like last summer . 
okay , calm down , here they are . 
i don't know , i don't know .
oh gosh , she's going to kill me .
ohh that'd be great !
okay , wait a minute . wait a minute , i i i , i can't do this . listen honey , this is , it's not phoebe's fault . she lent me the earrings , and i lost it . i'm so sorry . honey , i feel terrible too . 
your sunglasses ? !
honey , you have nothing to prove . and if you really like this girl , i don't flirting is the right thing to  
i'm sorry .
okay , well , i'm gonna clear out some of these boxes . 
hey ! hey !  hi ! hey hey hey , i'm rachel ! from upstairs ? the ones with all the pizza ?

i know , i know , but uh just , i'm telling you , once , once you get past that part , that where it it just feels like you wanna die , he's he's really a good person .
yeah . i'm i'm telling you he's really sweet and he's really funny and he's just ugh , got a good heart . and besides , i y'know , i think he really likes you .
well y'know , we have 7 people and like 10 pizzas , what do you think ?
 hey ross ? umm , i just ran into caitlin in the hallway and and uh , you must be getting better at this flirting stuff than i thought .
well , i don't get it , but she wanted me to give you her phone number . 
yeah !
i i i didn't ! i didn't ! she thought you were cute .
yay !
hey , you guys ! guess what ? barry and mindy are getting a divorce !
barry was the guy that i was almost married and mindy was my best friend .
yeah , but that just means that he was falling asleep on top of her instead of me .

you guys this cat is nothing like my grandmother's cat . i mean , it's not sweet , it's not cute , i even dragged that little string on the ground , and it just flipped out and scratched the hell out of me . and i swear , i know this sounds crazy , but every time this cat hisses at me i know it's saying , rachel ! 
well , i was gonna let you play with it .
 i give up you guys , i don't know what i'm going to do with this thing !
i tried ! they won't take her back .

rome . jerk missed his flight .
no . okay . i was at the airport , getting into a cab , when this woman   this blonde planet with a pocketbook   starts yelling at me . something about how it was her cab first . and then the next thing i know she just starts   starts pulling me out by my hair ! so i'm blowing my attack whistle thingy and three more cabs show up , and as i'm going to get into a cab she tackles me . and i hit my head on the kerb and cut my lip on my whistle .  oh .  everybody having fun at the party ?  are people eating my dip ?

then what's that big lump under your covers ?
that's not monica !
 oh god .

oh , wait and on the nineteenth a secret crush announces itself .
 oh my god ! it s joey tribbiani of mac and c.h.e.e.s.e . ! ! ! ! ! ! !
be because the last one was such a big seller ?
hey !

oh ! ross is sooo great !
 oh hi !
oh ! well let s look for them .  oh oh hey ! are these them ?
all right ! 
oh good .
 oh , wait ! sorry , mr . paul ? mr . paul ?
paul . umm , i just wanted you to know that ross really is a great guy .
you just don t look old enough to have a twenty year old daughter .
oh . we ?
oh no ! yes ! of course , i know that ! i just i meant y know are you still a  we  or are you just  you ? 
 ohh . so you raised her all on your own ?
ohh .  ooh !
i was just getting him to like you .
ross , joey is not here .
ross , it s okay . you can come out .
bye !
well , y know he lost his keys so he was looking for them 
no ! downstairs ! and we got to talking y know , for like two hours , and i really liked him so i invited him up here for a cup of coffee .
ross , what s the big deal ? so i kissed the guy !
wh you dated my sister !
what ? why ? !
ross look , look this is good for you . okay ? let s face it , so far the guy s not lovin  ya ! but i can turn that around ! i got the inside track ! we can all go out to dinner , y know ? and i can talk you up ! ross , the guy is a very , very successful lawyer !
oh it s important !
so it seemed that my prom date had stood me up , so ross selflessly , offered to take me .
wow ! i definitely did not see that one backfiring ! i m gonna go to the bathroom .
oh we were , but that was just a  , i mean that was just a big drunken mistake .
oh ! whoops ! i m sorry , you were talking about emily !
i mean if you think about it , i mean ross did learn something from each marriage .
now wait a minute that s not fair . he was married to me a hell of a lot longer than he was married to emily , he just didn t tell me .  maybe i have to pee again . 
 wait wait wait , i just thought of another story about how nice ross is !
oh ! i ve got a lot of those too !
i don't know why joey had to kiss her ! i mean , of all the girls at the party , god !
 be cause ross is the father of my child ! you know . . . and i . . . want him to hook up with lots of women !  i just . . . all i'm saying is . . . i don't think that joey and charlie have anything in common .
all right , so . . . ross , you're ok with all this ? i mean . . .
oh , oh ! wow , i love those ! where did you get them ?
 phoebe , shania twain is still alive !
oh , it's a gift certificate to this new spa in soho .
ah , why , now i can't get a massage ? there are so many things that she disapproves of ! i can't eat veal , i can't wear fur , i can't go hunting . . .
well , i would like to have the option ! !
oh !
phoebe , come on , i don't wanna waste it ! it would be like throwing away a hundred bucks !
i don't care about any of that ! !
oh !
oh , not as a friend , phoebe ! ! fine , i won't use it !

yah ! she's . . . uhm . . . not very good though . . .

 phoebe ! !
for like a half an hour ! man , you can lie about sweden !
how could you not tell me you worked here ?
yes you do , if you're going to make me feel guilty for getting a free massage !

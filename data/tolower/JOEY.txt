 thank you !
okay .
 pheebs , have you ever been bitten by a hungry italian ?
if you want i could loan you some money ?
oh , hey , how about this ? wanna be an extra on my show ?
yeah , yeah . the pay is pretty good and you could do it for as long as you need .
okay , now . i gotta tell you , being on tv isn't as glamorous and exciting as you think .
no it is awesome !
she sure does . why does she have a pink bow taped to her head ?
yes you are . i think it may be time for my sponge bath . sorry , i'm just so used to hitting on the extras . so , are you excited about your scene ?
oh , relax . don't be . you'll be fine , you'll be fine . they'll probably just make you stand in the back .
hey , you know what ? don't worry , pheebs ! it usually takes me three takes too !  alright , eight .
hey .
well , he can be a little rough around the edges , so i'm gonna replace a word he used a lot , with the word puppy .  okay , so he said : if your puppy friend doesn't get her puppy act together , i'm gonna fire her mother puppy ass . 
that's right , you're not . you're a nurse . you're nurse with tray .
no , no . nurse with tray doesn't know joey , she doesn't have time for friends . she gets in that operating room and she carries that tray to the doctor , because if she doesn't , people die !
 man with eye patch ! you get in there and you do your job .
okay .
oh , sometimes we use the same extras for different parts . it's okay .
maybe you are a nurse , but you moonlight as a waitress .
nice .
no , no . see , you and drake are having a fight .
he slept with you and then never called you .
oh , calm down ! she means on the show ! we need some new extras around here !
please don't fire my friend . just let me talk to her .
thank you , thank you . how about i do something for you ? tomorrow , i'll bring you a hat , cover up the bald ?
hey , listen pheebs . i was just talking to the director , and he was thinking , maybe this time you don't hit drake , you just wait on the tables ?
you're a masseuse . you have a table with a hole in it .
what ?
 yeah , you can fire her , but i would call security , she won't go easy .
probably monica and chandler .
hey guys ! look who s back ! it s ray ray !

okay 
hey .  it happened !
why are you taking this away from me ?

somehow they got the idea that you only invited them because of me . they feel a little unwanted .
look mon , if you could just call my mom 
come on ! look just just tell let her know that you really want them to be there . let s not forget , this is a woman that has sent you many lasagnas over the years .
is it her fault that some of them didn t make it to you ?
i don t know . just uh , just tell  em it was a mix up with the invitations , or no no no ! blame it on the post office . they hate the post office . and the irish ! but i don t think you can blame it on them so  
 hey .
listen , i know the invitation says 6:00 , but does that mean that you want people to get there at six , or the show is gonna start right at six ?
right . right . the wedding , gotcha . but i mean , it s gonna start a little late right ? i mean , weddings start late . right ?
ah . yeah . well look , the thing is it s the same day as my niece s christening and i really want my parents to be there in time to see me .  cause my part s just in the beginning i m not even in the rest of the show wedding !
okay . okay , i totally hear ya . oo how about this ? i vamp a little  til they get there ?

hi ! i m dr . drake remoray and i have a few routine questions i need to ask you .
i know , but i m a neurologist . and just to be on the safe side , dr . wells wanted a more comprehensive overview of you status so he sent me .
that was a test . good response . all right , full name .
date of birth ?
age ?
i m a doctor cliff , not a mathematician .
okay . and uh , are you married .
oh really ? so , 33 and still single , would you say you have commitment issues ?
 yes .
oh that s terrible . i m i m really sorry .
hmm . do you sleep with women and never call them again ?
excellent ! excellent ! and uh , finally , are you into any weird stuff y know , sexually ?
oooh , wrong answer . 
uh , well he s 33 .
a widower .
he seemed like a stand up guy . oh , and he s not into anything weird sexually .
 rachel s having her baby ! !  which is of no interest to me , i m a neurologist .
fake ? excuse me ? hello ? 
uh , if i may ? umm umm look , cliff , you told me a lot of personal stuff about you , right ? and maybe maybe it would if if would help if if you knew some personal stuff about her . uh , she was married to a gay ice dancer . uh , she gave birth to her brother s triplets . oh ! oh ! her her twin sister used to do porn !
right !
me neither .
there she is !
 she looks so real !  y know what i mean ! she s this whole tiny little person . she already has eyelashes and knees and uh oh .
oh no no , no for i second there i counted six fingers , but one was from the other hand so we re good .
what s the matter now ?
what was the other one ross ?
hey . i just saw a woman breast feeding both of her twins at the same time ; it is like a freak show up here .  what s the matter ?
what is it ? hey !
rach come on , what ?
what are you talking about alone ? what about ross ?
okay , how long was i watching that woman ?
yeah , i guess so .
hey , listen to me , listen to me you are never ever gonna be alone . okay ? i promise that s not gonna happen .
you don t have to worry about that okay ?
sure .
my god .
okay , ross , i realise that you didn't expect to walk in and see that , but . . let me explain , okay ?
rach , he just saw us .
but what you saw , that is the extent of it , okay ? one kiss .
look , we probably should have talked to you about this before it ever happened , but . .
yeah , but it did happen , so . . .
ross ?
no , no , no !
probably .
no , no !
really ?
ross . .
look , don't you think that will be a little weird ?
i do like fajitas .
ah , can i just say i know we're doing this for ross , and that's cool , but if it was up to me , this is not what we'd be doing on our first date .
i'd take you out for a romantic night . some champagne , fancy dinner , feel you up on the carriage ride home . . .
in a carriage !
hey , charlie !
so , did you bring a little something for ross ?
oh . oh , thanks .
yeah , i didn't throw any of that out . .
uh , actually , that's . .
okay , listen , hey , ross . why don't you try to relax , okay ? maybe have a drink .
dude , are you okay ? and when are the fajitas gonna be ready ?
dude , are you okay ?
you know what ? i think i'm gonna stay here and make sure he's okay .
yeah . i'll see you in the morning .
it doesn't look good , does it ?
morning . here you go .
yeah .
no , no , no . you actually did that when you were dancing to the chicago soundtrack . look , ross , about , about rachel and i . listen , you don't have to worry about that , okay ? because nothing is gonna happen .
well , she and i said from the beginning that we weren't gonna do anything unless you were okay with it . and clearly . .
it's okay , ross , alright ? i totally understand . of course you're not fine . you're . . you're ross and rachel .
that's what i hear , yeah .
come on , i mean , you know me , you know . . .
i'm crazy about her .
i think so .
yeah , but , ross , i mean , you're not okay with it .
no , no , no , no , that was    that was just for me . are you sure about this ?
and we're okay ?
all right , all right , all right , let's play one more time , ok ? and remember , if i win you do not move to paris .
just flip !
damnit !
hey !
try it , i can't feel a thing ! 
you guys hear a ringing ?
hey ! handcuffs ! and fur line , nice ! i didn't know you guys had it in ya !
mhm , maybe she used them with another boyfriend . maybe richard !
 hey .
oh , she's putting emma down , she'll be over in a second .
now it just hit her that she's leaving and she's kind of emotional so no one say anything to set her off , ok ?
what did i just say ?
who loses fifty seven coin tosses in a row ? head she wins , tails i lose .  wait a minute . . .
i forgot to pick up my dry cleaning !
huh , if i had to guess i'd say rachel is putting on the bubble wrap and phoebe is doing the punching .
i really made you think about that thing uh ?
 lucky bastard !
all right , let's think about this . i mean , there's got to be an explanation . uh . . . did you do anything to make her mad ?
i'm sure he's not more bummed out than i am .
oh , yeah , yeah , good idea . 
who's that dirty old lady ?
come on here , have a seat .
chandler , wait , wait , wait . . .
if you get a second , find out where she got that cheeseburger .
a little more .

hey , chan , can you help me out here ? i promise i'll pay you back .
i will , really . i'll pay you back this time .

oh , just , y'know . . . . science .
 . . . it's a fertility study .
alright , come on you guys , it's not that big a deal . really . . . i mean , i just go down there every other day and . . . make my contribution to the project . hey , hey , but at the end of two weeks , i get seven hundred dollars .
we make fire . cook meat .
oh , ok .
i don't know , she's , uh . . . . she's pretty great .
what , you think i'm gonna tell a girl i like that i'm also seeing a cup ?
well , the tough thing is , she really wants to have sex with me .

well , not so good . she definitely thinks tonight is the night we're gonna . . . complete the transaction , if you know what i . . .
then you do . heh , heh .
what do you mean ?
not following you .
 : that book got me through some tough times .
 that's good , just keep rubbing your head . that'll turn back time .
well , given that he's desperately in love with you , he probably wouldn't mind getting a cup of coffee or something .
the country .
he's right , cause if you're just gonna , like , break his heart , that's the kind of thing that can wait .
heh , heh . it was nothin ' .
 uhhh . . y'know what ? forget about me . let's , uh . . . let's give you another turn .

no reason , i m just saying that uh  that s where i ll be .
great nap .
 dude ! what the hell are you doing ? ! god ! 
i can t believe she would say that too you .

hey ! any good mail ?
ooh , it s probably a residual check , hey can you open it for me , i m kinda  .
hmm that s weird . i don t remember being in a move called benefits lapsed .
let me see that !
 oh , i can t believe this ! this sucks ! when i had insurance i could get hit by a bus or catch on fire , y know ? and it wouldn t matter . now i gotta be careful ? !
all right well , i guess i gotta go get a job . i m gonna go see my agent .
  look both ways before you cross the street .

what ? !
nothing ! well , i i got this blinding pain in my stomach when i was lifting weights before , then i uh passed out and uh , haven t been able to stand up since . but um , i don t think it s anything serious .
no way !  kay look , if i have to go to the doctor for anything it s gonna be for this thing sticking out of my stomach ! 
why did i have to start working out again ?  damn you 15s !
dude ! hernia operations cost like , a lot probably . besides it s getting darker and more painful , that means it s healing .
thank you , but it would take me forever to pay you that money back and i don t want that hanging over my head . okay ? besides , as soon as my insurance kicks in i can get all the free operations i want ! yeah , i m thinking i ll probably start with that laser eye surgery too .
hey !
look , i m telling you if i put my hand on my stomach right here  it doesn t hurt that bad .
sure , now i m scared .
yeah , but i don t wanna die !
 okay . hey , timmy , i ve got a surprise for you .

pssst . . .
well , he's with charlie now .
 you're a pain in my ass , geller !

 i like although !
six years ? wow . . . it's almost as long as highschool . . .

thank you . yeah , i appreciate that .
hey !

so you ve just married the one time then ?
 yeah . so uh ross , well now why did that first marriage breakup ? was it because the woman was straight or she was a lesbian ?
no . it just seems like ross is the kind of a guy that would marry a woman on the verge of being a lesbian and then push her over the edge .
have you ever slept in the same bed as a monkey ? !
fine ! have you ever got stuck in a pair of your own leather pants ? !
monkey lover !

pheebs ! sorry !
pheebs , i'm so sorry .

maybe you need sex . i had sex a couple days ago .
well , i ain't gonna say no to that .
hey !

y'know what ? make fun all you want . this is a great bag ! okay ? and it's as handy as it is becoming . now , just because you don't understand something , doesn't make it wrong . all right ? so from now on you guys are gonna have to get used to the fact that joey ,  comes with a bag ! 
 well , you must be new here . why don't we get a table and i'll buy you a drink .
yeah , sure .  well , you must be new here . maybe we should i'm sorry , can i ask you something ?

oh yeah , yeah ! he's done tons of commercials . i've seen him in like sugar smacks , playstation , and that one for the phone company . in fact he was so good in that one , he actually convinced me to switch phone companies . chandler was mad  .
that's great . listen , wouldn't it be great though if i got to play ben's dad ?
i look more like him than you do ! 
 yeah , i had to teach ross my bit because i actually didn't get a callback .

man , this is gonna be kinda weird .
hey pheebs !  hey !
ross good , i'm uh glad you're here . i wanna talk to you about something .
well , i've been thinking about this whole commercial thing , y'know me going up against ben , the two of us competing , and that can't lead to anything good . so , i think i'm just gonna step aside . i'm gonna tell them that i won't audition .
that's it ? you're you're gonna let me do this ? ! this this is my career we're talking about here !
i just said that so you wouldn't let ben do it ! look ross , if anyone should step aside it should be ben !
what ? chandler ! tell 'em !

do you know how hard this is gonna be on him when he doesn t get it ?
oh , come on ! have you seen what my kid can do ? ! huh ? ! i mean he dials phones ! he he he eats tortilla chips ! he he plays soccer with the cartoon tiger !

you re right . maybe i shouldn t even go on the call back .
well that s true . and i am only naked in one scene . plus it sounds really great . my character s catholic and he falls in love with this jewish girl . who run away together and they get caught in this big rainstorm . so we go into this barn and undress each other and hold each other . it s really sweet and and tender .

yeah , the other day i was at the bus stop and this lovely fall breeze came in out of nowhere and blew this chick's skirt right up . oh ! which reminds me , i'm also thankful for thongs . 
i mean , it's not so much an underpant as it is a feat of engineering . i mean , it's amazing how much they can do with so little material ! and the way they play with your mind ! is it there ? is it not there ?
oh , come on ! i wanna hear it ! it wouldn't be thanksgiving without chandler bumming us out !
man , it must be so cool remembering stuff like that ! i don't have any past life memories .

oh hey , you should be excited about him . there s nothing wrong with him he s a good guy .
yeah . ya know what i think ; i think we were all just being too negative .
actually , you have a little bit of an edge .
nothing 
ok , you know what blows my mind ? women can see breasts any time they want . you just look down and there they are . how you get any work done is beyond me .
no plans , huh ?
why do you have to break up with her ? be a man , just stop calling .
my god , angela .

come on , we were great together . and not just at the fun stuff , but like , talking too .
what ?
fine , fine , so , why don't the four of us go out and have dinner together tonight ? you know , as friends ?

yes ! i will have the lobster ravioli .
what s the rush ? what ?
whoa whoa , what is it ?
a date ? ! no , no pheebs you you must be mistaken , because i know you wouldn t schedule a date on the same night you have plans with a friend !
no , i m gonna ! ! that s right ! yeah , you made me feel really guilty about goin  out with that girl ! like like like i did something terrible to you ! and now pheebs , you re doing the same thing !
okay , well my girl from the other night was special . she was a scientist too !
well , she graduated from high school !
fine !
fine !
 what are you still doin  here ? ! i told you , lobster ravioli !
no ! no ! no pheebs , i m not gonna yell at you . i just y know , started thinking about you and david and i remember how bummed you were the first time he left . and i just  oh pheebs , come here .  are you okay ?
hey , y know you could always visit him .
anything i can do ? whatever you need .
i can give it a shot .
 all right , what are we havin  ? 
 look at you . since when do you roller blade ?
cool .
well , you might wanna make a little extra , y'know you ll probably be hungry after the sex .
hey .
check the freezer . if there s none in there , then we re probably out . are you just getting in from work ? it s late .
i discovered i m able to count all of my teeth using just my tongue .
oh , i was reading it last night , and i got scared , so .
well , safer . y'know , i mean i never start reading the shining , without making sure we ve got plenty of room in the freezer , y'know .
haven t you ever read the same book over and over again ?
the question should be rach , what is not so great about the shining . okay ? and the answer would be : nothing . all right ? this is like the scariest book ever . i bet it s way better than that classic of yours .
all right , you got it .
okay .
ah , now rach , these ah , these little women .
how little are they ? i mean , are they like scary little ?
these little women . wow !
oh yeah ! amy just burned jo s manuscript . i don t see how he could ever forgive her .
but jo s got a crush on laurie .  oh . you mean it s like a girl girl thing ?  cause that is the one thing missing from the shining .
no wonder rachel had to read this so many times .
 what are you doing ?  get back over on your side of the . . .  hello ! !  hi , i m joey , we haven t met .
hey robert , could you ah , ha , pass me those cookies ?
hey !  how s it going ?
hey , rach , how you doing with the shining ?
oooh , the next part s the best , when that dead lady in the bathtub . . .
all right i ll talk in code .  remember when the kid sees those two blanks in the hallway ?
oh , all blank , and no blank , make s blank a blank blank . oh no no no , no , the end when jack almost kills them all with that blank , but then at last second they get away . aww !
hey ! mine was by accident ! all right , the boiler explodes and destroys the hotel , and kills the dad .
beth , beth dies ?
is that true ? if i keep reading is beth gonna die ?
then why would you say that ? !
beth is really , really sick .
jo s there , but i don t think there s anything she could do .
yeah .
 okay .
 hey ! 
 there s gravy ?
i think i left a donut up here .
hey !
 that that is a good trick .
chandler , look they re actors . they re there to do a job , just  cause they work together , doesn t mean they re gonna get together . i mean just  cause it happened with susan sarandon and tim robbins , it doesn t mean it s gonna happen with them .
tom cruise and nicole kidman .
okay look , look , let me ask you a question , when they were doing it on stage , was it like really hot ?
well okay , so then you re fine . the rule is when two actors are actually doing it off stage all the sexual tension between them is gone . okay ? so as long as it s hot onstage you got nothing to worry about . it s when the heat goes away , that s when you re in trouble .
look , you guys have been to every play i ve ever been in , have i ever had chemistry on stage ?
noooo ! !
hey mon ! want some pancakes ?
yep ! grab a plate .
no no , stay right there .  gettin  closer .
listen also we re uh , we re watching the game here saturday night , if people want to come over .
oh yeah , who s playing ?
all right pheebs , stick out your plate !
i don t know , it smells good .
 wow ! the new playboy !
come here .
oh , yeah , totally ! that s such a turn on !
oh ooh , that s the turn on .
oh oh oh oh , how i do it is , i look a woman up and down and say , hey , how you doin  ? 
 hey , how you doin  ?
well , you gotta give him something that he can t say no too . like uh , knicks tickets ! invite the guy to a knicks game , you re guaranteed he ll say yes !
absolutely ! and if it doesn t , can i get the extra ticket ?
what the heck is that ?
no ! forget her , man ! you don t need her , you don t need that !
dude , tell me she actually told you this .
whoa whoa , that that was just a theory ! there s a lot of theories that didn t pan out . the lone gunman . communism . geometry .
okay , for next time , what do you say ?
what s ready ?
i don t know , it looks the same .
oh yeah !
how d it go ?
 dude ! what are yo you trying to kill me ? !
hey , what is with the secrecy phoebe ? huh ? and what about this denise , is she cute ?
hey rach , listen i was thinkin  uh , i m gonna have an extra room over at my place 
yeah , why don t you move in with me ? it ll be great ! we could stay up late , watch movies , and you know about naked thursday s right ?
hey !  dude , some guy just called for you .
i don t know ! how about , thanks for taking the message .  jeez ! 
hey , what s up ?
but you re still moving in together , right ? because my ad came out today . 
yeah ? i just figured y know , after living with you it d be an interesting change of pace to have a female roommate , y know ? someone i can learn from , someone someone who s different than me . and what s more different than me ; a guy who s not 19 than say a girl who is 19 ? enh ?  not just a hat rack my friend !
 everything on your application looks really good ohh ! just one last question umm , are you and your friends gonna be over here all the time like partying and hanging out ?
whoa ! ! now look , don t be just blurtin  stuff out . i want you to really think about your answers . okay ?
oh don t listen to him , he s just some guy who really wants the apartment , but i don t think he s gonna get it .
that thing was a hazard !  i m very safety conscious .
umm , listen , ross do you really think this moving in with rachel is a good idea ?
yeah well , maybe you should go back ! okay ? rachel moves in , and before you know it you re right where you don t want to be ! back together !
that s not gonna work out ! then she s gonna come home all weepy and you ll be tellin  her , oh that s okay . you ll find someone .  and then , bamn ! she finds you !
i am telling you ross , she is definitely gonna fall in love with you again ! now , is that what you want ?
here she comes . hold on , i m gonna make your life much easier .
or not . uh , rach , why don t you just move in with me ? 
no no no no no no no no  it s okay , i mean i look rach , i know i scared you off with that whole naked thursday s thing , but we don t have to do that !
thursday s clearly not good for ya , pick a day !
 hi !
come in . thanks for comin  back , umm , okay there have been a lot of people interested in the room , but i have narrowed it down and you are one of the finalists !

i don't know , but one of the extras sure did !  hey , listen rach . thanks again for coming down to watch my scenes !
also so gay !
well , at the christmas party him and santa did some definitely gay stuff !
oh , wish me luck !
rach , i gotta say .  if you weren't here wondering if these guys were gay i don't know if i could do this !
hey !
oh , you know , the writing was good , and the director is good , and . . . and my co star's good but they're not as good as me !
ow , i'm just going over the script now ! you wanna read lines with me ?
oh , all right , i can ask monica .
right . . .  ok , so just from the top of the page , right here .
what ?
ah , rach , it doesn't say that !
but , but . .
hey !
 oh man ! i thought i got it all !
i was making a peanut butter smoothy , right ?
and i couldn't find this little plastic thing  that goes on top of the blender .  and i thought .  well . . . how important can that be , right . . . ? turns out very !
what ?
oh .  i don't think it's going very well . . .
well , i'm feeling really insecure about the one we are shooting tomorrow . . .
a little . yeah no , i really am worried , you know , i mean i have to make it convincing that i'm in love with olivia .
so .  i've never played that !
uh .  well .  just once .  with you . . .
 what the hell are you talking about ? ?
 oh ! ok , yeah , i think i can do that . yeah ok , there's this party scene coming up . . and olivia and her husband are there and all drake wants to do is grab her and kiss her , but he can't . . . and that makes me think about all those times when i wanted to grab you and kiss you , but you didn't know so i would just pretend everything was cool , but really , it was killing me .
well . . hey , you know what else i could use ? there's a scene where drake sneaks into olivia's bedroom , and she doesn't know he's there    which never happened with us ! and he knows he shouldn't be there , but he just wants to look at her . . . you know ?  and i remember all those mornings before you even put on your make up , when i would think to myself , my god , she .  is . . . beautiful . . .  and it hurts so much , cuz i knew i could never tell you  but it was worth it just to be there looking at you .
 thanks dude ! !!this is great ! ! 
look , i ll come to the party but i m not dressing up .
no way ! look , halloween is so stupid ! dressing up , pretending to be someone you re not

 hey !  oh .
yeah , i didn t know you guys were going to be here .
 what ? ! why ? !
nothing !
all right ! there is something . i kinda had a dream ,  but i don't want to talk about it . 
well , it involved monica .
don't worry , there wasn't any sex in it or anything . i haven't dreamt about her like that since i found out about you two   ish .
well , okay . you were my girlfriend and we were doing the crossword puzzle . y'know like you guys were doing last night . so , that's it . i'm in love with monica and i'll be moving out .
it it doesn t ?
that kinda sounds like your dream dude .
in the dream i did enjoy the closeness .
 not really .
no , i don't think it's just about just getting a girlfriend . y'know ? i mean , yeah , i can get a girlfriend ! yeah , we could sit in the chair and do crosswords , but y'know are we ever going to have y'know the closeness like like you guys have ?
friends first ? that's interesting .
no , never done that either .
 how you doin ' ?
oh , i'd love too , but i got acting class . but y'know what ? i guess i can blow that off ,  for you .
uh , hey , rach let me ask you something . uh , i was just over there talking to monica and chandler , boy they are really tight .
yeah that's not such a bad situation they got going over there . i'm thinking of getting me one of those .
well , the reason i think monica and chandler are so great 
 is because they were friends first . y'know ? so i asked myself , who are my friends ?  you and phoebe , and i saw you first . so 
i'm saying maybe you and i crank it up a notch .
i'll treat you real nice . 
won't won't that take longer ?
yeah . i understand . i understand .  man , i wish i saw phoebe first !
 hey !
yeah , yeah , i met this woman . 
uhh , well , she's really good in bed .
 well look , hey , it's all your fault !
well because you didn't give me advice ! no ! you gave me a pickup line ! as soon as i told her i wanted to y'know , build a foundation and be friends first . i suddenly , through no fault of my own , became irresistible to her !  and her roommate !
closeness shmoshness ! there was three of us for crying out loud !
 all right ! hey , who wants pizza ? !
 oh , great ! can you believe i found it on the second floor ?
uhh , just a minute officer ! !
i know . ross is getting married .
everybody s doing stuff !
 we could climb mt . everest !
no no no no no , i saw an ad for this video , people climb that thing everyday ! we could totally do that !
yeah !
hey !
we re gonna climb mt . everest !
we could get that everest video though .
and while we re down at the video store , you know what else we could rent ? die hard !  oh , y know what ? i just remembered , that everest thing is only available through mail order .
yeah . yeah .
yeah we are !
it's never gonna happen .
don t answer that .
awful ! horrible !
she was nothing compared to you .
ewwwww !
 hey , pretty smart ! tissue paper ! you re at the wedding , you have to cry , handkerchief ?  no no , i got my invitation . 
hey !
don t worry man , i get to bring a guest . we ll show him .
i knew that !  i sooo didn t know that , but you should see your faces .
heyyy . 
he broke up with julie . well , go hug her , for god's sakes .
lookin ' good mr . cotter .
it s better ! you can t go to a museum in your underwear !
i bet we could get videos of all the sites , get a vcr in our hotel room . . . we'd never even have to go outside !
oh ho ! i bet the british version is gooooood !
 okay , so we went to the beach , because phoebe found out about this lady who knew her mom and dad , and i don t really know what happened with that .
 oh , and then monica joked that she wouldn t go out with a guy like chandler . . .
  .  and he couldn t let it go , and . . . i don t really know what happened with that either .
 oh oh ! and then ross s new girlfriend , bonnie , shows up and rachel convinced her to save her head . and then ross and rachel kiss , and now ross has to choose between rachel and the bald girl and i don t know what happened there either . . .
y'know what , hold on , let me go get chandler . 
whoa , wait , pheebs , wait a second ! don t you wanna stay here and talk about it ?
 hey , you guys ! take a look at this !  check this baby out , dug me a hole !
oh no ! no ! ! my hole ! !
 what ? ! what ? ! ! what is it ? !
yeah , and i m a little tired from digging the hole .
well , there s really only one thing you can do .
you re gonna have to pee on it .
don t blame me , i saw it on the discovery channel .
if you want some privacy you can use my hole .
me too .
no ?
sure , it s hard to forget ! but that doesn t mean you have to talk about it ! a lot of things happened on that trip that we should never ,  ever talk about .
it s between us and the sea , ross !
nope .
all right . 
well , we have to say something ! we have to get it out ! it s eating me alive ! ! monica got stung by a jellyfish .
and i was tired from digging the huge hole !
i d seen this thing on the discovery channel . . .
that s right i stepped up ! she s my friend and she needed help ! and if i had too , i d pee on anyone of you ! only , uhh , i couldn t . i got the stage fright . i wanted to help , but there was too much pressure . so so i uh , i turned to chandler .
 that s  cause sometimes i just do it through my wall to freak you out .
great ! all right , so i ll call you later .
that would be casey . we re going out tonight .
no , things are fine with kathy . i m having a late dinner with her tonight , right after my early dinner with casey .
yeah yeah . and the craziest thing is that i just ate a whole pizza by myself ! 
yeah . why are you getting so upset ?
what is the big deal ? it s not like we re exclusive .
you got all that from the back of her head ?
who s elaine ?
 hey , it s me . listen casey and i were on our way back and had a little car trouble .
we broke down on the parkway , so i have to walk back and get some transmission fluid . and hey , listen could you please tell kathy that i ll be there as soon as i can .
 cause i only have one quarter , and i think my time is about to 
yeah ?
me too , but i guess i do have a couple of more 
 hey dude , it s me .
listen uh , i m really sorry , it looks like i m gonna be stuck here for a while . i got the transmission fluid , but when i went to put it in the car , the transmission wasn t there !
yeah , it must ve fallen out a few blocks back . i just figured we hit a dog .
listen uh , could you put kathy on , i wanna apologize .
aww man ! i can t believe i locked myself out again ! 
 oh my god ! what happened here ? did you do all this ?

oh , you are the best friends anyone has ever had .
oh no no no , you are ! you do this , you give me the great advice , and hey listen , i was thinking about what you said yesterday about focusing on one woman , i m gonna do that .
no no no , i think i m gonna see how things go with kathy . she s pretty cool .

well , we only had samboucha , so it is now .
what s up ?
you do ?
well , you re timing couldn t be better . she s not my girlfriend anymore .
yeah , she broke up with me .
just now , after acting class . at first i thought she was doing some kind of scene , that s why i let people watch .
well , i ve been better . but , i m all right . so you like her huh ?
no no no , no it s uh , it s okay .
yeah . you know why ?  cause you came to me first .
but hey , listen just so you know , you might have you re work cut out for you .  cause when i talked to her , i kinda got the feeling that she s into some other guy . so 
who ?
what ?
and what ? ! did you sleep with her ? !
what ? ! ! that s even worse ! !
i don t know ! but it s the same !
who cares ? ! you went behind my back ! i would never do that to you !
over the line ? ! you you re you re so far past the line , that you you can t even see the line ! the line is a dot to you !
is that why you bought all this stuff ? !  well , y know what i will not watch your tv , i will not listen to your stereo , and there s a cinnamon raisin loaf in the new bread maker that i m not gonna eat ! you know why ? !
because it s all tainted with your betrayal . from now on this apartment is empty for me ! and i m not happy about you either .  oh , and just so you know , i made that bread for you . 
 hello .
 hello .
 stop callin  ! !
all right !
hey !
i m sending back all this stuff that chandler bought out of guilt .
no ! i m putting that in my room .
back when you and rachel were together , if chandler had kissed her , would you hear him out ?
five years .
hey ! don t do the crime if you can t do the time .
no , was my best friend . anyway , i don t know why you re pushing for him so hard . with him out of the way as my best friend , there s a spot open .
yeah !
what ?
all right . but if you weren t my best friend .
 hey gunther , have you uh , have you seen chandler ?
 
my folks .
i don t know . i might stay there for a few days while i look for an apartment .
yeah , y know at first i thought we could talk about this y know , work it out , but uh , seeing you two together i don t think i 
look , it s not about her . okay ? but seeing you two together just reminds me of what you did . and i don t want to live with some one who doesn t know what it is to be a friend . so , i ll see ya . 
yeah ! you did ! and that s why i m leaving .
when that guy was robbing us , and i was locked in the entertainment unit for like six hours , you know what i was doing in there all that time ? i was thinking about how i let you down !
yeah ! but if would ve know what kind of friend you were gonna turn out to be , i wouldn t have worried about it so much ! see you around !
we ve got a box . 
 what s twisted ?
ewwwww ! ! ew ! ew ! ew !
he s fine !
chandler ?
hey !
he s doin  some thinkin  !
you kissed my girlfriend !

what is the big deal ? 
yeah , it's kinda sweet , sorta like , uh . . .
exactly .
 gimme a box a juice . well , they switched me over to hombre .
or maybe it's because this guy's doing so good they wanna put more people on it .  you should see this guy , chandler , he goes through two bottles a day .
i know , but , i was the best , you know ? i liked being the best .  i don't know . maybe i should just get outta the game . they need guys up in housewares to serve cheese .

these new kids , they never last . sooner or later , they all .  stop lastin ' . listen , uh , what do you say i buy you that cup of coffee now ?
question . was ah ,  egg the gellers !  the war cry of your neighbourhood ?
booo ! !
 hey , you guys !
guess what ?
i got a gig !
well , it s not a part , no . i m teaching acting for soap operas down at the learning extension .
yeah , yeah . it s like my chance to give something back to the acting community .
 i know !
good evening . i m mr . tribbiani . and i will be teaching acting for soap operas . now um , on my first day as  dr . drake remoray on days of our lives ,  i learned that one of the most important things in soap opera acting is reacting , this does not mean acting again , it means , you don t have a line , but someone else just did . and it goes like this .  thanks , thanks , a lot . oh , by the way , before i forget to work in soap operas some of you will have to become much more attractive . all right , moving right along .
hi !
oh it was great . yeah , you get to say stuff like ,  hey , the bell doesn t dismiss you , i dismiss you . 
oh , and guess what , i got an audition for all my children .
yeah , it s this great part , this boxer named nick . and i m so , so right for it , y'know , he s just like me . except he s a boxer , and has an evil twin .
hey , monica bought a bed from the mattress king ?
you want me to lie to chandler ?
no .
hey , you re ah , pretty good at this .
ahh !
hey now !
hey ! ! ! oww ! ! and i m bleeding .
okay , great .
okay .
all right . i can t see .
okay , some tricks of the trade . now , i ve never been able to cry as an actor , so if i m in a scene where i have to cry , i cut a hole in my pocket , take a pair of tweezers , and just start pulling . or ah , or , let s say i wanna convey that i ve just done something evil . that would be the basic  i have a fishhook in my eyebrow and i like it   okay , let s say i ve just gotten bad news , well all i do there is try and divide 232 by 13 .  and that s how it s done . great soap opera acting tonight everybody , class dismissed .
hey hey .
awww , one of my students got an audition . i m so proud .
you bet ! what s the part ?
wow ! that was good . that was . . . tweezers ?
whoa . that was really good .
well , i i might ve said supergay .
because , monica , the guy s so good , and i really , really want this part .
 there will come a time in each of your careers when you ll have a chance to screw over another soap opera actor . i had such an opportunity in the recent , present . and i m ashamed to say that i took it , i advised a fellow actor to play a role , homosexually . yeah , we both auditioned for the part , and uh , as it turned out , they ah , they liked the stupid gay thing and cast him . and now , he s got a two year contract opposite susan luchhi , the first lady of daytime television , and me , me i m stuck here teaching a bunch of people , most of whom are too ugly to even be on tv . i m sorry , i m sorry , i m sorry .  thank you .
all right , jester man , look we wanna see the king .
oh ho kay , i m talking to the king . 
well , we were ! but ross was talking so loud on his phone they threw us out !
 he's talking to london !
well no , not yet . he's calling everyone on her side of the family hoping that someone will help him get in touch with her .
ross ! way to suck up to the family .
 hey !
don't worry , i had it dry cleaned .
well , i'm doing this telethon thing on tv and my agent got me a job as co host !
a little uh , good deed for pbs and a little tv exposure , now that's the kind of math joey likes to do !
why don t you like pbs , pheebs ?
i'm sorry pheebs , i just , y'know , i just wanted to do a good deed . like like you did with the babies .
whoa ! whoa ! whoa ! what about you , having those babies for your brother ? talk about selfish !
well , yeah , it was a really nice thing and all , but it made you feel really good right ?
it made you feel good , so that makes it selfish . look , there's no unselfish good deeds , sorry .
well , may i ask for one example ?
that's because all people are selfish .
are you calling you people ?  yeah , well sorry to burst that bubble , pheebs , but selfless good deeds don't exist . okay ? and you the deal on santa clause right ?
that he doesn't exist .
 how ya doin ' ? welcome . good to see ya !
that's great . but uh , i'm not really expecting a lot of calls .
but i'm the host !

so did you uh , happen to catch my toast up there ?
well , i d like to think there was something for everyone . look , i know you re casting for this new show 
oh , see that s where you re wrong . whatever it is i can do it . and if didn t see it up there , just just try me .
well i m not proud of this , but

 it is ? ? ?
no .
no .
 all right , you re right . i ll talk to her .

hey . uh , can i talk to you for a second ? this , uh , kid in this picture . do you , uh , know this kid ? is that like a relative or something ?
yeah , that s what i was afraid of . . okay , uhh look janine i really want you to feel at home here , but some of this new stuff . it s too girly .
like this .  pictures of cute babies we don t know . we  we can t have that .
look i don t know this baby . i don t know if she s a famous artist or not . you know , and i don t want to be a jerk but you re changing too much around here .
yeah but it s too much stuff . you know like , you got the candles and the foofy schmoofer thing here and over here you got a picture of a watering can .
i m sure it s a famous watering can , okay . but , come on and what is with the really hot stick in the bathroom ?
ohh , well , that s ok then . but , okay my towels for instance . i come in to the bathroom here and my towel is not on the floor where keep it . it s up here on some hook  and smells different .
yeah , well , it feels different .
alright , i can make my peace with the clean dry towels also what is with these chips you bought ?
 well that s like summer in a bowl .
hey chandler . come on in . we re knitting pot holders .
so what s really neat . if you sear the stems of the flowers first in a frying pan , your arrangement will look fresh much longer .
ohh , i love birds . 
what ?
hey . hey look i am still joey , okay . flowers they re just , you know , they re nice to look at . and that happens to be a picture by a famous artist . of a famous baby .
no i m not . why would you say that ? that s just mean .
it s not what you said . it s the way you said it .oh my god , i m a women ! ! !
hey , uhh , i need to talk to you .
i m sorry but we ve got to get rid of all this girlie stuff in here . i , uh , i got to be a man ! okay . the living room has to remain a guy place , okay ? that s just the way it has to be .
great great and thanks for being so understanding . i mean , i didn t want to make a big deal out of this , you know .  you could , uh , put the picture of the famous baby in my room . i mean , if you want to .
and , uhh , maybe the watering can there .
and a couple of these little tiny boxes .
 okay .
yeah , right ! . . . . .  y'serious ?

yeah , sorry , the swallowing slowed me down .
yeah , calm down . you don't see ross getting all chaotic and twirly every time they come .
alright , when'd'ya have it on last ?
 . . .  well , this is still ruined , right ?
your folks are really that bad , huh ?

all right they got water , orange juice , and what looks like cider . 
 yep , it's fat . i drank fat !
we have a half hour .

glass of fat ?
what's a matter ross ? what you're nervous about your speech ?
am i in it ?

well , actually the last place you were sitting was in there  . soo . . .
all right ! you can have the chair .
oh my , would you look at that ! 
i'm so sorry .
me too . in fact , i think i might be a little too comfortable .
monica , how are you gonna do that ?
wow , what a cool job .  'you have two new messages . ' 'please , pass the pie . '
hey , you can't say you're breezy , that , that totally negates the breezy .
now she sounded breezy .
okay . 
you said i had to give you the chair , you didn't say anything about the cushions .
that's right ! i'm taking the essence .
 where's my underwear ? !
because , i'm not wearing any underwear now .
it's a rented tux . okay . i'm not gonna go commando in another man's fatigues .
okay , you hide my clothes . i'm gonna do the exact opposite to you .
hey , opposite , is opposite ! 
okay , buddy boy . here it is . you hide my clothes , i'm wearing everything you own .
look at me ! i'm chandler ! could i be wearing any more clothes ? maybe if i wasn't going commando . . .
yeah . whew , it's hot with all of this stuff on . i ah , i better not do any , i don't know , lunges . 
yeah , ross , way to ruin it . i was just going to get dressed .
you could drink the fat .
yaaaay !
let's see what else he'll do !
wow ! this girl is good .
 so ah , phoebe tells us you write jingles .
 ah , anything we might of heard of ?
 wow , that was kinda brutal .
ah , he can t make it , he said he had to his . . .  whoa oh ! 
phew , close one .
 hey .
is ah , is chandler around ?
oooh .
nooo . no , no , ah , are you sure it wasn t something that sounded like ginger , like ah , gingeer ?
aww , man . that s the girl i was hiding from . when she finds out he s my roommate , she s gonna tell him what i did .
what , oh , oh , oh , no , no , i can t , i can t tell you that , it s like the most awful , horrible thing i ve ever done my whole life .
all right ! ! okay , it was like four years ago . okay , ginger and i had gone out a few times , and then this one weekend , we went up to her dad s cabin . just me , her , and her annoying little dog pepper . well that night , i cooked this really romantic dinner . . . .
i wish . no . after dinner , me , her , and pepper all fell asleep in front of the fire . well i woke up in the middle of the night and i saw that the fire was dying out . so , i picked up a log and threw it on . or , at least what i thought was a log .
i wish . see , i guess another thing i probably should ve told you about ginger is that she kinda has a ah , artificial leg .
i ran ! !
 morning .
 heard about the leg burnin  huh ?
listen , i ah , i know it s a longshot . but , by any chance did she find that funny ?
yeah . you okay ?
yeah .
where have you been ?
tell us !
 so you re the gynaecologist ?
and it s not fake , it s totally brutal .
what ? my hands are totally clean , i just gave the duck a bath .
yeah , maybe it s like y'know , that jock thing . y'know how football players pat each other after touchdowns . 
yeah . what are we getting ?
yeah , or you can teach him a lesson . y'know ? what you could do is you could rub something that really smells on your butt , all right ? then , when he goes to smack ya , his hand will smell .  now what could you rub on your butt that would smell bad ?
 hey , the fight s starting !
 fight s over !
check it out , he s winning !  pete s winning !
no o o ! !
 previously on friends .
yeah . we figured when we couldn t find you , you d gone home to make up with rachel . which is probably what you shoulda done . huh ?
look , ross look , i m on board about this totally honesty thing , i am , just not about stuff that s gonna get you in trouble .
yeah , and there won t be a relationship left to rebuild .

morning , roomie !
fifth day's a charm .
hey , it's great having you back . you know , stay as long as you want , and when does she stop crying all night ?
she's probably exhausted from all that adorable screaming she did last night .
no , hey , it's been great .
yeah . and look , i just want you to know that with rachel staying here and everything , all my feelings from before are totally over , okay ? and even if they weren't , when you accidentally walk in on a woman using a breast pump . . .
wow ! so , how are you ?
really ?
well , actually it . . .
wow , really ?
sure , i know lots of girls .
ooh , names ?
hey . i was just gonna get something to eat . you want something ?
i'm fine , i'm fine , it's just , it's just weird what's happening with her and ross . you know , yesterday he asked me to fix him up with somebody .
why are they doing this ?
you know what's crazy ? these jars . what is it , like two bites in here ?
i know , i know . and when they moved back in together , i figured y'know , that's where things were headed .
yes , and they should name one of their kids joey . i may not have kids ; someone's gotta carry on the family name .
yeah , because it is slim pickings . i had this date last night : yuck ! but we should probably keep it down ; she's still in the bedroom .
i know ; that just pushes them further and further apart .
ooh , that's a great plan !
shhh ! not so loud , we don't wanna wake up , uh . . .
hey .
all right ! who is he ?
she's this really boring woman . she's a teacher !
yeah , yeah , she's really into history and foreign movies . . . and oh , oh , she loves puzzles . huh ? come on , who loves puzzles ?
oh my god , you're right !
she even reads for pleasure !
what ? i'm not allowed to know smart women ?
i met her at the library . i went in to pee .
well , okay , i'll    i'll just call her and tell her the date's cancelled , and find him somebody else .
ooh .  i hear that's bad .
ah , yes , the plan ! 
yeah , you know , it's not that fun .
oh , great , pretty soon they'll be back together .
hello ?
emma ? hey ! hi !
how are ya ? how are ya ? where are your babysitters , huh ? why's the bedroom door closed ?
you can't have s e x , when you're taking care of the b a b i e !
because you two were having sex !
don't you lie to me ! i could tell by chandler's hair .  you are so lazy . can't you get on top for once ?
hey ! it is unacceptable that you two would have sex with emma in the next room . i'm gonna have to tell rachel about this .
hey , i gotta ! unless . . .
unless you name your firstborn child joey .
hey , i may never have kids , and somebody's gotta carry on my family name .
  you almost had me .
uh huh .
it's easy , you just walk in on them having sex .
we're geniuses ! yeah , look at them , look at them , they're really bonding .
where ?
can you believe they're still not here ?
i know , i'm so bummed . can we have our free crab cakes now ?
we've been stood up .  and we want our free crab cakes .
monica ? what time is it ?
but it's dark out .
i guess i'll get washed up then . watch that sunrise . 
hey !
doesn t seem like it's going to work , i mean 
hi !
so i'm thinking , basically we pick it up and then we flip it .
 well , remember when they got in that big fight and broke up and we were all stuck in her with no food or anything ? well , when ross said rachel at the wedding , i figured it was gonna happen again , so i hid this in here .
you don't know how long we're gonna be in here ! we may have to repopulate the earth .
hey , you're back !
how was your conference ?
oh , so your weekend was a total bust ?
hey , you're back too !

who cares ? you're rachel !  who's kip ?
oh , that poor bastard .
hey , mr . bing . that uh , hotel you stayed at called . said someone left an eyelash curler in your room .
'cause i figured you'd hooked up with some girl and she'd left it there .
y'know , i i don't even feel like i know you anymore man ! all right , look , i'm just gonna ask you this one time . and whatever you say , i'll believe ya .  were you , or were you not on a gay cruise ? !
  hey , rach ? sorry to interrupt but umm , phoebe wanted me to talk to you about a trip or something .

i think i'm gonna take off .
you guys , can we please not watch this all right .
 oh , you said it mike .  aw ! there's got to be a better way !

 wow , it is easy .  now , i can have milk everyday .
 hey !
maybe you can tell me . my agent would like to know why i didn't show up at the audition i didn't know i had today . the first good thing she gets me in weeks . how could you not give me the message ? !
how is it you ?
yep , that's my audition .
well , estelle tried , you know . the casting director told her that i missed my chance .
pheebs , you can't do that . the casting director doesn't talk to friends , she only talks to agents .
what , what are you doing ? what are you doing ?
hang up , hang up . 
i love that movie . 
i'm sorry , it just felt nice .
hey , i only got one good arm , you know . you should be doing stuff for me . go get me a sweater .
hey , you know about that ? !
well , i've never been through the tunnel myself , 'cause as i understand it , you're not allowed to go through with more than one girl in the car , right . but , it seems to me it's pretty much like anything else , you know , face your fear . it have a fear of heights , you go to the top of the building ! if you're afraid of bugs . . .  get a bug . right . in this case , you have a fear of commitment , so i say you go in there and be the most committed guy there ever was .
oh , yeah . go for it man , jump off the high dive , stare down the barrel of the gun , pee into the wind !
come on baby , come on !
thank you so much .
you were amazing , could you just do me this huge favor , you see there's this one other audition that i really , really want , and estelle couldn't get me in .

it's okay , these things happen .
i'm , i'm okay . see . 
no ! no , no you can't quit ! you're the best agent i ever had ! look pheebs , rejection is part being an actor , you can't take it personally .
they actually said that ?
no , no , no , see that's why you have to do this job , agents always lie . you know , estelle just says stuff like 'they went another way ' , but this , i can use this .  i canna work on a new accent .
okay , shoot .
i didn't get it ?
okay , what else ?
oh .
look , it's okay , no , no , no , really , look um , i really appreciate this pheebs , but i think i'm gonna have to go back to estelle .
yeah , well don't get me wrong , you're a better agent than she is , but at least with her i don't want to blow my pretty dumb brains out .
you do , thanks .
wait a minute .
wait a minute , did you just make up all that stuff just to get out of being my agent .
 that's ah what i suspected ah .

i bet ross was in on it too . i mean he was conveniently busy .
 hey ross . it s joey . there s a hooker over here and we thought maybe you d know something about it .
maybe she meant to get you a hooker .
maybe she wants you to learn something . huh ? now is there anything you re really bad at y know , sexually ?

hey , maybe that's for the best .
yeah . you know ? you just . . . look , you gotta . . . you gotta think about last night the way she does , okay ? maybe , maybe sleeping together was the perfect way to say goodbye ?
maybe that's okay . you know ? maybe , maybe it is better this way ? i mean , now , now you can move on . i mean , you've been trying to for so long , maybe now that you're on different continents . .  right ?
maybe now you can actually do it . you know ? you can finally get over her .

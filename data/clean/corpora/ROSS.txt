I ll be there Monday . And thank you again !  Okay .   Umm , that was the head of the Paleontology department at N uh , Y , uh U ! Well remember that paper I had published last year on sediment flow rate , huh ? They loved it . I know ! Anyway , they asked me to be a guest lecturer ! I mean it s temporary , but uh , if they like me it could lead to a full time job . How great would that look great on a mailbox , huh ? Professor Geller .   Hey everyone ! Hey uh , well , today s my first lecture and I kinda wanted to try it out on you guys , do you , do you mind ?  There are three primary theories concerning sediment flow rate . Each of these theories can be further subcategorized into two distinct      subcategories . The first of these subcategories is   No ! Why ? Ohh ! Okay ! Okay .  There are three  primary theories concerning sediment flow rate .   Each of these theories  can be further subcategorized  into   Open with a joke ? It s a university , not a comedy club !  Okay ! Thank you ! Please don t say naked chicks . I I I don t even know why I bother to talk to you guys about it . Y know what ? I m just gonna do it on my own with no naked chicks .  Hello ! It went great ! And I didn t need any jokes or naked chicks either ! I knew all I had to do was let the material speak for itself . Everyone s all , Ross you have to be funny and sexy .  Well , I proved them wrong ! And now , I m gonna pass the news onto Joey and Chandler . That s right !  Right ! So when Rigby got his samples back from the laboratory he made a startling discovery ! What he believed to be igneous , was in fact sedimentary . Imagine his consternation when  Oh bloody hell . Look , I was nervous ! You guys had me all worried I was going to be boring ! I got up there and they were all like staring at me . I opened my mouth and this British accent just came out . Will you will you please ? Oh .  I m sorry , I ve got plans with my sister .  Right , will you excuse us for one moment ?   What are you doing ? Just please stop !  Look , I really need some help , okay ? Why ? Why did I have to speak in a British accent ? ! What do I do ? They re not listening too me ? Monica you really think I should try this phasing out thing ?  All right , keep going . We are phasing the accent out , phasing it out . So without out re testing the results in the laboratory  the team would never have identified  the initial errors in their carbon dating analysis  . Were there any questions at this point ?  Yes .   Come again ? What s what s this nonsense ?   All right , I m I m not English . I m from Long Island . I was really nervous and the accent just uh , just came out . I m sorry . So , if we could just get back to the lecture . Umm , were there any questions ?  About paleontology .  All right , look I was just trying to make a good first impression . Obviously , I screwed up . But what you guys think of me is really important because I m I m hoping to get a permanent job here . So if you just give me another chance to make a good impression   Well , hello Rachel ! What did you want to show us ? Because all I can see is this bitchin ' van ! I don t know , I could maybe go out for a couple of beers , but there s this thing about bumblebees on The Discovery Channel that I was planning to watch . Nooo ! ! Gandolf ? ! Gandolf is coming to town ? Dude , we are sooo gonna party ! Mike Gandolf  Ganderson , only like the funest guy in the world . I m gonna call after you ! Joey , you are gonna love this guy . Gandolf is like the party wizard ! Gandolf the wizard .  Hello ! Didn t you read Lord of the Rings in high school ?  Hey ! Okay ! I got my passport , fresh socks , and a snake bite kit ! Somewhere maybe along the equator ? What happened ? Ohh , man ! Chicago , is sooo lucky ! It s Gandolf , and he s not coming . No ! I balanced my checkbook . I can t believe he didn t come ! Yeah ! We d meet , we d meet total strangers , and hang out with them ! There s other stuff too . Yeah ! Yeah ! ! It s not like we don t know how to party ! !  Hey hey hey , when uh , when were we on a boat ? Yeah . Okay . I m kinda beat . Yeah , me too . I m just glad I brought that extra pair of socks , y know ? I used them as mittens , I didn t want to touch a thing in that last place . How sad are we ? And so what if I like to go home , throw on some Kenny G , and take a bath !  . . . finally . . . God , you're amazing . . . I didn't even have to ask you to call me that . Weh . . .*sigh * Yeah , It's just . . . I don't think I can do this . . . No , NO !  Look , I need to talk to Joey . I mean , you guys just broke up . Before anything more happens between us , I need to know he's okay with it . Alright , I'm gonna go find them . . .  I just need a . . . need a before I can . . . you know .  Grandma . . . grandma . . . grandma . . .  Okay , I see you later . Hey , what are you guys doing ? Okay , uhm . . .

Unless , you know we re never going to have to use it . You did see the folder . You know it s a boy ! I don t think so ! You re just giving me Ruth so you ll get to name it when it s a boy , and that s when you ll swoop in and name him Heath or Blaine or Sequoia . Veto . Unless   You anticipated that I would figure all this out and you know that it actually is a girl , and you really do want her to be named Ruth ! Well , I m not falling for that ! Okay ? Ruth is off the table ! Not like this ! So , I uh  I called the doctor and now we both know the sex of the baby . That s right . The student has become the master .

I mean I I I'd walk in there and I'd be like , Yo , dad ! You and me outside right now !   I kinda scared myself . Well , maybe he just didn't want to hurt your feelings . What kind of problem ? Nooooo ! So , I just finished this fascinating book . By the year 2030 , there'll be computers that can carry out the same amount of functions as an actual human brain . So theoretically you could download your thoughts and memories into this computer and and and live forever as a machine . Hi !  So uh , wha uh , what do you do ? Thank you for bringing her into our lives . Yeah , yeah man don't do it . I mean if you date her , then then then I can't date her . Monica had such a crush on him . Yeah , she used to kiss his poster every night before she went to bed . Yeah . Hey !  Wow , couples who live together do start to look alike . So , Mondler .  uh , what uh , what  cha doin ? Did you get Monica's authorization to move all of her stuff ? Put it back exactly where you found it ?  Kay , first of all , this attitude is not helping . Whoa , hello , did you just meet Monica ? Hmm  you know , actually this'll work out well . Cause when you have to move back in with Joey , Joey's hot new roommate can come and live with me . Look Chandler , Monica is really weird about this kind stuff all right . Believe me , I lived with her for 16 years . She is going to freak out . Oh my God , she's going to sit on you . Yeah , the phone was facing the other way .  And that goes back up there . Yeah that that , doesn't look right . Whoa , whoa , but then the back of the couch won't line up with he back of the carpet . Whoa , Whoa , Whoa , but then the coffee table won't be centered in the seating area . Hey , I've been married 3 times Look , we do not repel women OK ? That is completely untrue . Yeah , well what about you ? You weren't you know , so hot in college either . After everything he said , he'd go ba dum bum chessh  Oh y'know what , girls don't like it when I start talking about science . Uh , they don't like it when you correct their grammar . They don't like it when you keep asking them if they like you .  I'm never gonna find love again . Who cares ? I repel women .  What ? ! Why does anyone have to be naked ? I I had to show Chandler something ? Yeah yeah I uh , I have a uh , a guy problem . Dude , what'd you have ?  The photo album ! There were millions of pictures of the apartment in the photo album . We just go through it and match everything to the pictures . So really , what'd ya have ? Bye !  So it said that by the year 2030 , there'll be computers that can carry out the same number of functions as an actual human brain . So theoretically we could download our thoughts and our memories into this computer . . . That's so Janine , you you you know what , do you know we're doing right now ? You and I , we're interfacing . I m sorry the answer there would be .  none of us . Yeah , I ll take some . What ? Hey , y'know while we re on that , when are you gonna tell my sister that you don t live here anymore . Phoebe , she doesn t know that you sneak out every night , she doesn t know that you sneak back every morning , and she doesn t know that you ve been living with your Grandmother s for a week now . Hey . So how many more do you have tomorrow ?  Sure , your dresser is missing but this she notices . I have to go . Yeah , Carol should be home by now , soo . . . Oh , better , actually . Y'know I I I think I finally figured out why we were having so much trouble lately . Yeah , y'know how I have you guys , well she doesn t really have any close friends that are just hers , but last week she meet this woman at the gym , Susan something , and they really hit it off , and I I I think it s gonna make a difference No real   , honey , really it s fine , just g go with Susan . Really , I , no , I think girls night out is a great idea . Okay , okay , bye I don t know , something girlie .  Hi . Where is everybody ? My marriage , I think my marriage is um , is kinda over .  Cause Carol s a lesbian .  And , and I m not one . And apparently it s not a mix and match situation .  I m an idiot . I mean shoulda seen it , I mean Carol and I d be out and she d , she d see some beautiful woman , and , and she d be Ross y'know look at her , and I d think , God , my wife is cool ! Well , now I do ! ! Seven years . I mean we ve been together seven years , she s the only woman who s ever loved me , and the only woman I ve I ve ever . . . . Maybe this would ve happened if I d been more nurturing , or I d paid more attention , or I . . . had a uterus . I can t believe this ! Thanks . Thanks .  Wait , wait , wait , wait , wait . Wait , wait , wait . My foot is stuck in the pocket . No , I can t get it out . No , come on don t start .  Ouch ! Stupid balls are in the way .  Oh well . It probably would ve been the most constructive solution . Huh ?  My wife s a lesbian . Hi . Hey ! What's up ? Hey Joey ! Great stuff huh ? Of course it is . Yeah , come on in . Ooh ooh , go by the window you can pretend to be surfing .  Yes . I lived with you guys for a while and then I found this place .  I'm Ross . You got ink on your lip .  Hey !  Who isn't ?

I know , it's crazy ! We were just pushing Ben on the swings   Okay ! ! All right , I gotta take off . I'm picking up Ben then we're off to the big audition . Yeah . Yeah the dad and Ben eat soup and pretend to enjoy it . You're not his godfather .  Of course I am !  Okay , let's go godfather . Really ? That's great ! Yeah well , he's not gonna get this one .

Listen man , uh , I'm sorry the audition didn't go so well . No really , I I am ! I feel bad ! Yeah y'know what ? Maybe maybe you didn't mess up your audition because you suck , maybe you messed up because you care more about uh , your godson . I think , sub consciously   I think on some level , you you sabotaged your own audition so that Ben would get the part . No ! There you go . Thank you ! No . A no sex pact huh ?

Um , she walked in and I had the room filled with lilies , her favorite flower  Then , Fred Astaire singing The Way You Look Tonight came on the sound system , and the lights came down . And I got down on one knee and written across the dome in the stars were the words Will you marry me ?  Oh , no , Mom , it s just Monica this year . No , of course , Um  Um , everybody ? Um , I I just wanted to say on behalf of my new bride , Rachel  , and myself . Umm , that if if in 35 years , we re half as happy as you guys are , we ll count ourselves the luckiest people in the world .  and then , we could ve gone from the ceremony to the reception with you in the sidecar ! But having a dove place the ring on your finger would ve been no problem ? Yeah ! And ! And , it was the easiest 400 bucks I ve ever made . Yeah . I know , I know it was stupid . No , actually I thought about it when , when we were going out . It s how I imagined I uh , I would ask you to marry me . It s a good thing I didn t do it , because it sounds like it would ve been a very expensive wedding .  Okay , good night Even if the sidecar had a windscreen so your hair wouldn t get messed up ? That s all I m askin  Y know I don t understand why they didn t cry . It was a beautiful speech . Hey ! All that stuff you said about true love , you were right , I mean , we did learn a lot from Mom and Dad ! And that picture of Chi Chi with her mischievous grin . And what you said about Nana . Ohh , yeah she really would ve wanted to be there . And you know what ? I think she was . Not that big a deal ? It's amazing . Ok , you just reach in there , there's one little maneuver , and bam , a bra right out the sleeve . All right , as far as I'm concerned , there is nothing a guy can do that even comes close . Am I right ? Multiple orgasms ! Not even , say , breaking up with Janice ? Tony ? Oh , yeah , last week you had a wonderful , nutty , chocolatey kind of a cakey pie thing .  Nothing , just , just , I'm fine . That guy , he burns me up . So , uh , Rachel , what are you , uh , what're you doing tonight ? Oh , you uh , you wanna hear a freaky coincidence ? Guess who's doing laundry there too ? Me . Was that not clear ? Hey , why don't , um , why don't I just join you both , here ? Yes , I do have a laundry room in my building , um , but there's a . . . . rat problem . Apparently they're attracted to the dryer sheets , and they're goin ' in fine , but they're comin ' out all . . . . fluffy . Anyway , say , sevenish ?  Ok , bye .  Well , Monica's not coming , it's just gonna be me and Rachel . It's laundry . The thinking through is minimal . Nuh uh . So what're you saying here ? I should shave again , pick up some wine , what ?  No . Ok , ok , now what is wrong with my Snuggles ? What , it says I'm a sensitive , warm kinda guy , you know , like a warm , fuzzy bear . Ok , I can pick something else up on the way . What's goin ' on ? Was your basket on top ? So ? No suds ? Excuse me , hold on a second .  That's my friend's machine . Hey , hey , hey , that's not the rule and you know it .  All right , show's over . Nothing to see here .  Ok , let's do laundry . Well , that's because you're such a sweet , gentle , uh .  Do you , uh , do you .  Oh , hey , uh you must need detergent . Uberveiss . It's new , it's German , it's extra tough . Rach , do you uh , are you gonna separate those ? Rach , have you never done this before ? Uh , well , don't worry , I'll use the gentle cycle . Ok , um , basically you wanna use one machine for all your whites , a whole nother machine for colors , and a third for your uh , your uh , delicates , and that would be your bras and your under panty things .  Uh , that , that , that would be a judgment call . That does not sound stupid to me . You know , it's like the first time I had to make dinner for myself , after Carol left me ?  I'm sorry , that's all the time we have . Next on Ross . . . Uh oh .  Uh oh , uh oh , the laundry's done . It's , uh , it's a song . The laundry song that we sing .  Uh oh the laundry's done , uh oh , uh oh . Nothing , nothing . Lee lo , the laundry's done . All right , all right , it's just that you left a red sock in with all your whites , and now , everything's kinda pink . Yeah , uh , except for the red sock , which is still red . I'm sorry , please don't be upset , it could happen to anyone . You got the clothes clean . Now that's the important part . You were incredible ! Brand new woman , ladies and gentlemen . Ok , um , uh , more clothes in the dryer ?  I'm fine , I'm fine . No . Yeah . Yeah . What a beautiful story . Hey , I'm fine by the way . What s the matter ? You okay ? Okay . Yeah , I guess , I guess I could do that too . Yeah , I kind of uh , have something else planned for you guys . Sorry , I m kinda keeping this one on the Q.T . What ? A brain transplant ? ! It s ridiculous !  It s winter , they are fewer people on the street .  Yeah yeah , help me out here , when you come out of the brain transplant ,  you are going to be her ? What ? ! Oh well , it sounds to me like your family is ready to uh , rediscover its Scottish roots . Well yeah yeah the Scottish history is so much more  How did you know about that ? ! Were you the ones called the cops ? ! Why not ? Come on that s not fair ! I mean you haven t even heard me play ! No , you ve heard my practice . Okay ? Just just give me a chance to perform for you and then decide whatever you want . And I m not going to tell you what song I m gonna play either . But uh , let s just say when it s over I ll bet there will be a we bit o  celebration .  now remember you have to imagine me in a kilt .  Do you wanna start telling secrets ?  Now umm , remember I m still learning . One , two , three , four ! You know the song ! Sing along ! So ? You know the song ! Sing along ! Wow , did not know that ! May I say how lovely you look today ? Thanks .   Oh ! So for tomorrow , do you want to rent a car and drive down together or what ? Cousin Frannie s wedding , its tomorrow night . No .

Hey , y know what nickname never caught on ? The Ross A Tron !  Phoebe he s right , that is the rule . Hey Joe , while you re over there how about another beer for the Ross A Tron ?  Hey . So I finally heard back from Aunt Sheryl and apparently it wasn t a mistake . Ahh , there s there s limited seating in the hall . Well yeah , but she doesn t know that . I mean , the last time she saw you you would ve turned one of those little wedding chairs into kindling . Oh what s the big deal ? ! I wasn t even invited to the ceremony , just the reception . And and y know what ? If it makes you feel any better , Joan and I will just make an appearance and then , and then we ll we ll leave early as a sign of protest . Yeah , Joan Tedeski my date .

I don't want her telling Emma she needs a nose job . Emma . Well we haven't offically asked them yet , but we would want Monica and Chandler . well . . its just . its just in that case , then um . Emma would go to my parents . Yeah and we'd want to make sure Emma has someone like Monica who is more uh . uh discliplinarin . . someone who can be firm and strict . No , you both are equally capable . Its just . . you're strongest when . . when you're together . Sure , Monica would have to give her up . Hey dude , you okay ? Sorry about before . Emma . Dude . Well done . You know what ? If I die , and Rachel dies and Monica dies then you can totally take care of Emma . So , so now do I get Joey ?

I know . I know . I mean , one day , he's this little thing , and before you know it , he's this little thing I can't get off my leg . No , no . The vet says unless he's in a place where he has regular access to some . . . monkey lovin , ' he's just gonna get vicious . I've just gotta get him into a zoo .

Here's an affordable place ,  two bedroom , close to work , ooh , it's available in five weeks ! Oh , I I don't know , it's kind of expensive for a studio . Okay , let's go . Oh oh ooh , hey guys , I was wondering if you guys would uh , maybe chip in on some new air filters for the air purifier ? I mean after all , we all are using it . Oh my God !  I think this is it . I don't know , maybe we should keep looking .  So , you you think I should go ahead and take this place ?  How about you ? All right , I see what you guys are saying . I'll uh , I'll go downstairs and fill out an application . Hey . So I uh , I didn't get that apartment . Some problem with my application . Yeah . But , the good news is that Phoebe said that I could stay at her place for a while . So  Look , you guys don't need me here taking up your space . Are you guys sure about this ? All right . So I'm a pimp huh ? It's okay ! Look , I know that sometimes I can be a pain in the ass , but you just have to talk to me . Tell me if something is bothering you . Okay ? And for my part I will do everything I can to keep my annoying habits just  .  Come on , it's fun !

Hey , you guys won't believe what I have to do for work today .   There're these two professors who are joining my department and I have to meet them here and show them around campus .

Oh , no , it's no big deal , I mean , if I weren't doing this I'd just , you know , be at the gym working out . Oh , ha , I wrote that in one minute .   We should probably get going , you know , we got a lot of ground to cover . I don't think so . Oh , well he's obviously late and the rule in my class is if you can't come on time , then don't come at all  .  An option that many of my students use .  Shall we ? You know what , he's a big boy , I'm sure he'll find us , ok ? Oh , damn it !  So , where did you get your undergraduate degree ?  Oh , it's not over ! So basically all nuts ?

Especially after working alongside a Nobel Prize winner like Albert Wintermeyer ? You . . . you dated Albert Wintermeyer ?  . . . And you called him Alby ! ?  I mean that's like . . . like calling Albert Einstein . . . er . . . Alby . . . Eh , you think ? I mean , you went out with a guy who improved the accuracy of radiocarbon dating by a factor of 10 !  Oh ! like what ? !  Oh I'm sorry , I don't mean to pry . . . it's just that this must be what regular people experience when they watch Access Hollywood  . Who is intimidating to a guy who won the Nobel Prize ?  Two ? Wha . . . ? Don't tell me you dated Benjamin Hobart Oh my God ! Have you ever been in a relationship with someone who hasn't won the Nobel Prize ? Oh yeah ? no , no Nobel Prizes for him ? Huh . . . huh . . . what a loser ! Some more wine ?   Oh Great ! After I finish my wine I'm going to blow my . . . eh . average sized brains out . She . . . she only dates geniuses and Nobel Prize winners . Oh my God , at the chinese restaurant earlier today , I put chopsticks in my mouth and pretented to be a woolly mammoth . Of course you would , your brains are smaller than mine ! !  Man , I can't compete with the guys she goes out with , they are so out of my league ! oh my God ! Oh much , much worse . I did my impression of Joan Rivers as one of the earliest amphibians . . .  Can we walk  ?  Oh , you . . . you like that ? What ?  Nice to meet you . Oh , I'm no actor , I'm a professor of palaeontology . Oh , well no , but I mean , she only goes out with really , really smart guys . I'd lead with that . Just some boys gave me their phone numbers . It's actually a 1,000,000 $ prize . Yeah , maybe . I do have my whole career in front of me . I mean , I can still win a Nobel prize . Although the last two papers I've written were widely discredited . And sexy .

Dude , I need to talk to you a sec . Okay , I think I might know why my parents don t like you . Okay , remember , we were young . Hey , Spring break , sophomore year , I got high in my bedroom and my parents walked in and smelled it and so I told them that you had gotten stoned and jumped out the window . I don t know , aheh , your s was the first name that that popped into my head , I m I m sorry . I I didn t think it would matter . How was I supposed to know we d end up being friends after college , let alone you you would be living with my sister ? I don t know , I I was all high . Okay , okay , I ll tell  em it wasn t Chandler who got high . Now who should I say it was ? Alright , alright , now now who should I say tricked me into doing it ? Okay , fine ! Oh , uh , can it wait a second Joey ? I have to tell my parents something . No it can t ? Okay . What ? ! What is with everybody ? It s Thanksgiving , not .  Truth Day ! Okay , okay , we ll just get everyone to act like they like it . That that way noone makes fun of her and we still get to go to Sweet Potatoe Pie !  Hey Rach , can I talk to you outside for a second ? So um .  Thanksgiving . The holiday season is upon us , hm ? And um .  You look nice today . What ?  Eh ?  You re alone .  Ah well , can t blame a guy for trying ! Wha ? No no ! Ah !   All gone ! So good ! Maybe Chandler has some left . It tastes like feet ! Are you kidding ? Oh yeah , about telling Mom and Dad , I was thinking about maybe writing a letter . Wha what ?   You are such a tattletale ! Mom , Dad , you remember that that time you walked in my room and smelled marijuana ? Well I told you it was Chandler who was smoking the pot but it was me . I m sorry . Yeah , well , Hurricane Gloria didn t break the porch swing , Monica did ! Monica and Chandler are living together ! I I uh , I got tricked into all those things !  Hey ! How come ? Everybody else does . Oh , umm , I'm just getting rid of a couple of things . Yes , yes it is ! No , but it's good it's Emily thinks we should get all new stuff . Stuff that's just ours , together . Y'know brand new . Touched . Used . Sat on . Sleep on . Look , if I can just do what Emily wants and get her to New York , I'm sure everything will be fine . After what I did ? Can you blame her ?  No no no , it's just a bit sudden .  No , it's great . Okay ? I'm totally on board . I love you too , all righty . Bye .  Nothing . Oh , actually , great news ! I just got off the phone with Emily and it looks like I'm moving to a new apartment . Woo hoo ! Well , her thought is , and I agree , fresh new furniture , why not a fresh new apartment ? Her cousin has this great place to sublet , it's got a view of the river on one side and Columbia on the other . Yes ! Yes ! I mean it's it's kinda far from work , but uh , y'know , I'll get so much done on the commute . I I've been given the gift of time !  I know I miss you too . I can't wait to see you . I love you . Bye .  No no , this is my collection of fossil samples . I'm really gonna miss this apartment . Y'know , Ben Ben took his first steps right over there .  I loved this place ! To tell you the truth , I wish I didn't have to move . Well , I mean if uh , if Emily gave me a choice  Why ? What's going on ? Unreasonable ? How about we have this conversation when one of you guys gets married ! You have no idea what it takes to make a marriage work ! All right , it's about compromise ! Do you always like it ? No ! Do you do it ? Yes ! Because it's not all laughing , happy , candy in the sky , drinking coffee at Central Perk all the time ! It's real life , okay ? It's what grown ups do !  Yep . Y'know what ? I'm really not in the mood . Look , this is hard enough ! I really need you guys right now . Okay . Thanks you guys . Pheebs are you wearing fur ? You do , huh ? What are you talking about ? Wait ! Wait ! Wait ! Y'know what ? Just stay . Please ? It uh  It would really mean a lot to me if you stayed . Hey ! Hey , look ! Ugly Naked Guy's back ! Hey !  Yeah yeah , we're just having dinner .  Uh , yeah , sure uh hold on .  She wants to say hi .  Hold on . Y'know what ? Uh , Rachel is here !  Yeah , yeah , she's here .  Hi .  Look Emily , I'm just having dinner with my friends , okay ? Emily that's ridiculous . Look , I'm I'm moving for you , I'm cutting friends out of my life for you . Please , just get on the plane and come to New York . Okay , you'll see you're the only person I want to be with . Well , you can't know where I am all the time . Look , this marriage is never gonna work if you don't trust me . So , can you trust me ? Well , I guess that's it . My marriage is over . Yeah . You can help me get my furniture back from Gunther . Ironically , most of the boxes seem to be labeled clothes . Hey ! Hey ! If he's moving , maybe I should try to get his place ! It would be so cool to live across from you guys ! Oh my God ! I love this apartment ! Isn't it perfect ? ! I can't believe I never realized how great it is !  Ohh .   What's going on ? What ? ! What ? ! Actually , it looks really good .   Hey ! Well , I called over there and it turns out Ugly Naked Guy is subletting it himself and he's already had like a hundred applicants . No no , I got the edge . I know it's not exactly ethical but I sent him a little bribe to No . No . A basket of mini muffins . The small one . Well yeah ! Someone sent us a basket at work once and people went crazy over those little muffins . It was the best day . Oh man ! I want that place so much ! ! I was so sure that was gonna work ! There's twelve bucks I'll never see again !  Noooo . Look I've already looked at like a thousand apartments this month and none of them even compares to that one ! Huh ? That is a great idea ! And ! I know Ugly Naked Guy because we've been watching him for like five years so that gives me back my edge ! Oh , let's see now he had the trampoline . Well , he had gravity boots . Okay , I've got to go pick up Ben but I I will figure something out .  Hey , didn't he used to have a cat ? Right .  Good evening , sir . My name is Ross Geller . I'm one of the people who applied for the apartment . And I I realize that the competition is fierce but I'm sorry . I , I can't help but notice you're naked and  I applaud you . Man , I wish I was naked . I mean , this this looks so great . That is how God intended it . A new place for a new Ross . I'm gonna have you and all the guys from work over once it's y'know , furnished . Well I am that . And that whole rage thing is definitely behind me . Oh Donald that that would be great . I am totally ready to come back to work . I What ?  No ! Wh  What are you doing ? ! !  GET OFF MY SISTER ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! Marcel . Bring me the rice , c'mon . Bring me the rice , c'mon . Good boy . Good boy . C'mere , gimme the rice .  Thank you , good boy . Well , I see he's finally mastered the difference between 'bring me the ' and 'pee in the ' .  'Bring me the ' and   Rach ? Hi . Really . Whoah , uh , what happened to , uh , 'Forget relationships ! I'm done with men ! ' The whole , uh , penis embargo ? Wait wait . I , I got it . I was there . Yes . Yes . Yes ! Yes , I really do ! In fact , it's funny , very often , someone who you wouldn't think could could curl your toes , might just be the one who . . .  .  Gets interrupted . Hi ! Alright , I've gotta go . C'mon , Marcel ! C'mon ! We're gonna go take a bath . Yes we are , aren't we ? Yes , we are . That's right , you're gonna spend tomorrow at Aunt Rachel's , aren't you . 'Pwease , Aunt Monica , pwease ? ' Oh , unclench . You're not even gonna be there . I'm telling you , she said she's looking for a relationship with someone exactly like me . Well , I added the 'exactly like me ' part . . . But she said she's looking for someone , and someone is gonna be there tonight . Well , I think it's perfect . Y'know , it's just gonna be the two of us , she spent all day taking care of my monkey . . . Anyway , I figured after work I'd go pick up a bottle of wine , go over there and , uh , try to woo her . Hey . How did , uh , how'd it go today ? Yeah . You , uh , you want some ? Uh , okay , yeah , we could do that , but before we head off to the murder capital of the North East , I was , uh , kinda wanting to run something by you . Y'know how we were , uh , y'know , talking before about , uh , relationships and stuff ?  Well   Okay , quick and painful .  Oh , what ? What what ?  .  Yeah ?  I   I   I ca   I can't believe this . I mean , all I asked you to do was keep him in the apartment . No , y'know what , I guess it's partially my fault . Y'know , I shouldn't've , uh , asked you to start off with a monkey . I should've started you off with like a pen or a pencil . You called Animal Control ? Marcel is an illegal exotic animal . I'm not allowed to have him in the city . If they find him , they'll take him away from me . That's right , I . . 'cause I didn't expect you were gonna invite them to the apartment ! Yeah , we thought we had a monkey , but we we didn't . Cat ! My uncle Marcel . Marcel ? Marc   oh , this is ridiculous ! We've been all over the neighbourhood . He's gone , he's he's just gone . Oh come on . It's cold , it's dark , he doesn't know the Village .  And now I have a broken foot . I have no monkey , and a broken foot ! Thank you very much . Yeah , yeah . Y'know , now that you kicked the sign , hey ! I don't miss Marcel any more ! Oh , no no no . Nono , this is just vintage Rachel . I mean , things just sort of happen around you . I mean , you're off in Rachel land , doing your Rachel thing , totally oblivious to people's monkeys , or to people's feelings . . . I don't even wanna hear it , you're just . . . Oh , forget it , okay ? What ? What ? Hi , did you order some bananas ? Gimme back my monkey . Marcel ? Marcel ? Okay , where is he ? Where is he ? Marcel ? Marcel ? Marcel ! What've you done to him ? Are you insane ? C'mere , Marcel , c'mon .  C'mere , Marcel .  Okay , gimme my monkey back . Alright , I want my monkey .  You had to be a bitch in high school , you couldn't've been fat . It'll be nice to get this off finally , won't it ? Yes it will .  Or we can leave it on for now , that's fine . Listen , I'm   I'm sorry I was so hard on you before , it's just I . . . Yeah , but you were the one who got him back , y'know ? You , you were great .  .  Hey , we uh , we still have that , uh , that bottle of wine . You in the mood for , uh , something grape ? Alright .  The , uh , the neighbours must be vacuuming .  Well , so long as we're here and , uh , not on the subject , I was thinking about , uh , how mad we got at each other before , and , um , I was thinking maybe it was partially because of how we , um . . . We have got to start locking that door ! Hey , how d the date go with Mr . Millionaire ? Still ? ! I guess he musta gotten the part in that play .  Hello . So Rachel called . Wants to see me . Going over in a minute . Well , maybe the crazy fog has lifted and she realises that life without me . . . . a sucks . Then be supportive like a guy . Hi . You ah , wanted to see me ? What ? !

Oh well , I guess I ll catch up with her later . Oh no . I think I might know what this is about . Yeah . Uh , uh we promised we weren t gonna tell anybody this but uh , about a month ago Rachel and I slept together . Wow ! I thought you would be a little more shocked . Well , we we said we d just do it that one time but , but now I think she may wanna start things up again . Why ? What what else could it be ? I m telling you . I m telling you . That s what it is . No wonder she was looking at me all funny during the wedding . She didn t say anything to you ? Yeah , I guess I should .  Man , y know what I have to realize ? Maybe I m just not the type of guy women can have just one night with . Y know , they they always seem to want a little bit more . I should remember that .  Hi .  I think we do . Why don t we go inside ?  Look uh , I know why you re here . Yeah , and to save you from any embarrassment umm , I think maybe I should talk first . Okay .  Uh , Ross and Rachel . Rachel and Ross . That s been one heck of a see saw hasn t it ? I mean look , that that one night we had was fun and and certainly passionate , but don t you think it s better if we just stayed friends ? Okay . Okay .

And then when I turned around she was gone . But hey , in my defense I I just found out condoms are like only 97 % effective . I gotta go find her . Evidently they do . Hi ! Uh we we need to talk . Please , please I want to apologize for the way I acted earlier today . What ? Oh yeah .  I m sorry . I mean I I think I went a little crazy .

I m just saying if you can t eat by yourself , how do you expect to have a baby by yourself ? When have you ever ? Well certain other people take two hours to eat a bowl of soup ! I grew up with Monica ! If you didn t eat fast you didn t eat ! ! But not the husband , because evidently she can do this alone .  I don t know why you can t admit that you need me . Oh my God .

I'll give you a hint , he's looking right at you . Oh , I'm so excited , I mean , apparently I beat out hundreds of other applicants , included five guys I went to graduate school with . Not that I'm keeping score or anything . . . five ! Well , ok , it's for 25 thousand dollars . And if I get it , I'll finally be able to complete my field research ! And there will be an article about me in the Paleontology Review  ! Yeah ! That'll be the first time my name is in there , without people raising serious questions about my work ! Yeah . Why ? Your ex boyfriend ? So , your ex boyfriend is gonna determine if your new boyfriend gets this grant ? Wow , your new boyfriend is screwed ! Well , if you think it would help . Ok , now , is there anything I can do to . . . you know , butter him up ? Anything he really likes ? We'll see how dinner goes . I can't believe I'm about to meet Benjamin Hobart . I've always thought of him as one of the people I'd invite to my fantasy dinner party . Do you think there's any chance he'll bring Christie Brinkley or C3PO ? Well , I . . . I am having a good hair day . I'm ok . It's an honor to meet you . I can't tell you how long I've been an admirer of your work , I mean , that Nobel prize ,  whoooo ! I mean , I have to tell you that , you're one of the reasons I got into the field . No , but , it's , you know , it's just a funny image , you know , the two of you , in this restaurant , with . . . tzz zzz , mmm . Ok well , I would like to do a dig in the painted desert .

Uhm . . . your grandmother's nickname , perhaps ?  Aunt Margaret's pants size ?  No ! Stop !  Really ? I have to break up with Charlie ? You're crazy . Crazy !  Get out !  Your ex boyfriend is insane . No I didn't , and you want to know why ? Because your ex boyfriend is still in love with you . Yeah . He wouldn't give me the grant , because I wouldn't give you up . Really ? Is it ethical to ask someone in a grant review , who was the voice of Underdog  ? If you don't believe me , let's go talk to him , okay ? I'm telling you , he didn't ask me one paleontological question . Oh , I'm sorry , no . He did ask me one . Uhm . . . How do you spell Mboscodictiosaur ? Damnit ! I want you to tell her everything . About the deal you tried to make with me , about the crazy questions you . . . Wally Cox ! That's the voice of Underdog ! No , no , no . Don't do that !

She looks at me and sees a friend , that's all . But then I met Julie , and I don't know , we're havin ' a great time .

Well , then , I think , I think the guy is scum . I hate him . I mean I actually I I physically hate him . I always have . You are way too good to be with a guy like that .

Anyway , if you don't feel like being alone tonight , Joey and Chandler are coming over to help me put together my new furniture . Okay , sure .  I'm supposed to attach a brackety thing to the side things , using a bunch of these little worm guys . I have no brackety thing , I see no whim guys whatsoever and   I cannot feel my legs .  This was Carol's favorite beer . She always drank it out of the can , I should have known . You guys . I'm divorced !  I'm only 26 and I'm divorced ! That only took me an hour . You know what the scariest part is ? What if there's only one woman for everybody , y'know ? I mean what if you get one woman   and that's it ? Unfortunately in my case , there was only one woman   for her . . . I honestly don't know if I'm hungry or horny .  Grab a spoon . Do you know how long it's been since I've grabbed a spoon ? Do the words 'Billy , don't be a hero ' mean anything to you ? Y'know , here's the thing . Even if I could get it together enough to   to ask a woman out , . . . who am I gonna ask ?  I assume we're looking for an answer more sophisticated than 'to get you into bed ' . You got a job ? The word you're looking for is 'Anyway ' . . . Come on , you made coffee !   You can do anything !  C'mon , cut . Cut , cut , cut , . . . No . No , I gotta go home sometime . Yeah . Mmm .  Oh , no   No no no , go   Split it ? Okay .

Listen , do you think   and try not to let my intense vulnerability become any kind of a factor here   but do you think it would be okay if I asked you out ? Sometime ? Maybe ? Okay . . . okay , maybe I will . . . Goodnight . I just grabbed a spoon .  There's an image . Really ? Which one ? Things you find in the ocean ,  You're gonna be on Pyramid  ! ! Except for Match game  . . . Oh , and Chandler and I have this stupid college alumni thing . I can't believe you get to meet Donny Osmond .  Yeah uh !    .  and I'm a little bit rock 'n ' roll  ! So weird to see all these people again . . . Oh my God , look , there's Geoffrey Cleric . He was roommates with John Rosoff . He went out with Andrea Tamburino . She dumped him for Michael Skloff . Hey , there's Missy Goldberg . You gotta remember her . Dude . You're married to my sister . Hey , I hear she's single again , d'you think I should ask her out ? Yes please . Hey . Hey , check out the flyers for the band . I made 'em on a Macintosh in the computer room ! Thanks to a little something called Helvetica Bold 24 point  ! Hey , Missy . . . Yeah , yeah . You should come check us out . We're called Way ! No Way !  . Boss ! She's gone . Dude , I was gonna ask her out . Well , I thought it first , Holmes . Woha ! Wait . . . What are we doing ? What we have is too important to mess it up over some girl . I mean , we can get laid anytime we want . Me too . I'm good at it . You got it . Those are the pacts ! Oh , oh . . . maybe not you ! Thank you .  All right , here I go . Hey , remember how scary it used to be going up to girls in college ? I know , and I can't stop sweating .  So , Saturday night ! Great ! Oh , well , uh , this is gonna sound kinda silly , but , do you remember my roommate Chandler Bing ? It's been sixteen years but the air quotes still hurt . That's ok . Uh , anyway , well he and I both really liked you a lot , uhm , but we didn't want anything to jeopardize our friendship , so we kinda made a pact , that neither of us could ask you out ! Yeah , why ? You did ?  AND ON MY TURF ?  You made out with Missy Goldberg . How could you do that , after you promised me ? You broke the pact ! That doesn't matter ! We're talking about the foundation of our friendship . I didn't . No . NO ! I never did anything with Adrienne Turner . I don't know what . . . you're talking about . Listen Adrienne , you can't tell Chandler about this . Cool !  I didn't know you knew about that .  Man . . . I . . . I'm sorry . So , eh . I made out with Adrienne and you made out with Missy . Well I guess we're even . We are even , right ?  What did you do to my mom ? Hey , where's Rachel ? Did you know Chandler kissed Rachel ? Nineteen Eighty Seven . The weekend you guys visited me at school . Well , it matters to me . Because . . . the night you kissed Rachel was the night I kissed Rachel for the very first time . Okay , after you told me she was passed out in our room , I went in there to make sure she was all right . She was lying on my bed , all buried in peoples coats . Well , I went to kiss her on the forehead , you know . But it was so dark , I accidentally got her lips . I started to pull away , but then I felt her start to kiss me back . It was only for a second , but . . . it was amazing . And now , now I find out that you kissed her first . Mine . No , she was definitely on my bed . Well , then who was on my bed ?  NO ! No , no ! You were under the pile of coats ? OH MY GOD ! You were my first kiss with Rachel ? Hey ! I m sorry I m late , did I miss anything ? 15 ?  Your personal best !  Oh , on a date . Yeah , I met this girl on the train going to a museum upstate . Okay , it was just me and her at the back of the train , and I sat near the door , so she d have to pass by me if she wanted to switch cars . She was totally at my mercy . No , I m getting back down  cause she lives in Poughkeepsie . She seems really great , but she s like totally great , but she lives two and a half hours away . Oh , wow ! I should get going . I I got a date tonight . You know that girl I told you about who lives up in Poughkeepsie ? Not her . Yeah , this is someone else I meet , and I I can t decide between the two of them . Y know the one from Poughkeepsie , even though she s a two hour train ride away , is really pretty , really smart , and and a lot of fun . But this other girl , well , she lives right uptown . Y know she s , well she s she s just as pretty , I guess she s smart , she s not fun . Well , I I want to give her another chance , y know ? She lives so close . And , at the end of the date , the other time , she she said something that was if she was kidding was very funny . On the other hand , if she wasn t kidding , she s not fun , she s stupid , and kind of a racist . Hey ! I wasn t sleeping . The one with the cat . I gotta go , I ve got another date . No , it turns out that the one from uptown was making a joke . But it was a different joke than I thought it wasn t that funny . So I m still torn . Y know , you re right . Thank you .  What ?

Why would she think we re engaged ? ! I didn t give her that ring ! No ! It s mine . Yes ! No ! No ! ! Look . Look , my mom gave me that ring because she wanted me to propose to Rachel , but all I wanted to do is if she maybe kinda wanted ah start things up again . Look , I didn t want to rush into anything . And it seemed like she didn t want to either . But I don t , I don t understand how any of this happened ! What ? Did she find the ring in my jacket , assume that I was going to propose , throw it on , and and just start telling people ? Well I didn t ! I didn t propose !  Unless uh   Did I ?

Huh ? I mean no self respecting man would ask a woman , So , where is this going ?  Hey ! You were a closed book ! Okay ? I m not a mind reader ! Besides , I hate those conversations . I m horrible at them . Really ! Maybe maybe I need kind of a gesture . Y know , something that says we re moving forward without having to talk about it . Smaller than that . Uh , bigger than that . Whoa hello ! We were closer with the mixed tape . Yeah I I don t I don t think I m quite there yet , but I could say I looove spending time with you . Forget it . I I Y know what ? I ll just have the conversation . I ll just say I like things the way they are , and hope for the best . What do you think Rach ? Here we go .

Hey , I hope Emma isn't making it too hard on you . Yeah ? Yeah , that'll do it . I'm , I'm okay . Sure , I mean , do I wish me and Rachel living together would have worked out ? Of course . You know , I'm disappointed , but it's not like it's a divorce . No , it's not a divorce , it is not a divorce ! Anyway , I think Rachel and I need to , you know , get on with our lives , maybe , maybe start seeing other people . Yeah , sure , why not ? In fact , if you know anyone that would be good for me . . . Yeah ? Any names come to mind ? Excuse me , is there a woman waiting at the bar ? Someone average height , dark hair , perhaps doing a puzzle ? Well , if I'm still here in an hour , buy him a drink on me . Nah , I don't know if I should . I don't wanna be drunk when I go home alone . Yeah , it's no big deal . It's just a blind date . No ! Eh , if it was meant to be , it's meant to be . Wow , free crab cakes . Well , that's nice . Although I was hoping to have sex tonight . Just the crab cakes . What's    what's going on ? What ? You    you're making money off my misery ? This is unbelievable . I    I have never been so insulted in my life . Now , if you'll wrap up my free crab cakes , I'll be on my way . Hey , what's wrong ? Oh . Crab cake ? Well , what happened ? Monica told me you had a blind date . I did , too . But is it technically a date if the other person doesn't show up ? Why does everyone keep saying that ? That bad ? Female body inspector ? What size is that ? The first date we've had in months , and they were both such disasters . Wait a minute ; you don't think it was intentional ? I mean , that's just stupid . I know . A double blind date , and we both get stood up . What are the chances ?  Hey . Is Rachel here ? I gotta talk to her . Damn ! I told Emily to come . And I just need to y'know , talk to Rachel about it . Well look , I'm just trying to focus on the I get to see my wife ,  part , all right ? And not the part that makes me do this .  I have no idea . I mean  But but I assure you I will figure it out . So , Rach , y'know y'know how Emily's coming right ? Anyway it it kinda it all boils down to this , the last time I talked to Emily  What ? ! Le Poo's still alive ? ! Hey , so uh , y'know how there's something I wanted to talk to you about ? Well , y'know how I'm trying to work things out with Emily . Well , there's this one thing  Okay ,  here goes . I made a promise that   Oh hey ! You're nose is bleeding ! Umm   Okay , I uh , I can't see you anymore . Hey . Rachel , I I I've been wanting to tell you something for a while now and I really , I just have to get it out . Okay , y'know how you told me I should do whatever it takes to fix my marriage ? And while that was good advice , you should know that what what she wants   is for me not to see you anymore . It's awful I know , I mean , I feel terrible but I have to do this if I want my marriage to work . And I do , I have to make this marriage work . I have too . But the good thing is we can still see each other until she gets here . You have no idea what a nightmare this has been . This is so hard . What are you doing ? Rachel , this is your apartment . You should've seen the look on her face . I don't want Rachel to hate me ! I don't know what to do . Yes ! Please ! That's okay . That's not advice ! I'm going to the bathroom .   Pheebs , you mind if I speak to Rachel alone for a sec ? Hi . I talked to Monica , look , I'm the one who made the choice . I'm the one who's making things change , so I should be the one to y'know , step back . No , no , it's okay . Really . They're plenty of people who just see their sisters at Thanksgiving and just see their college roommates at reunions and just see Joey at Burger King . So is , is that better ? Well , what what would you do ? Rach , if you were me , what what would you do ? I can't believe this is happening . I am so sorry .  Are you intrigued ? There's my boy ! Here's my boy ! And here's his Barbi  What's ah , what's my boy doing with a Barbi ? Yeah , it's , it's , it's cute . Why , why , why does he have it , again ? You know what it's fine .

And Joey with no regard for his own safety throws himself on me ! Yeah , but but he didn't know that ! And it could've just as easily have been a bullet . Wow ! I could've died tonight . I do have a newfound respect for life . Rach , what uh , what are you doing here ? Y'know , it it doesn't matter . The important thing is that you're here . You're my friend , and you're here . Oh !  The most amazing thing happened tonight . I thought my number was up . I had an actual near death experience ! Okay , okay , we were on the ride along with Gary , right ? And somebody took a shot at me ! No , a car backfired , but  I thought somebody was taking a shot at me . And Rach , I I survived ! And I was filled with this this great respect for life . Y'know ? I I want to experience every moment . I want to seize every opportunity . I I am seeing everything so so clearly now .  Okay , why are you here ? You talked to her ? Well , okay , what what did she say ? Wow ! Huh ? Yeah ! Yes , of course ! Right . I guess , I guess I should call Emily . Okay , look , yesterday I would've even considered calling her back , but my ex wife calls on the same day I have a near death experience . I mean , that that has got to mean something ! You weren't there ! Okay , maybe this is something that I I'm supposed to seize ! Y'know ? Huh . That does make sense . Because I do wanna seize some opportunity , but I I really don't wanna see or talk to her . Yeah . Maybe today is just , close call day . Hey , thanks Rach .  Oh wait wait wait ! The message is blinking . Maybe you didn't erase it .  Hey Ross , it's you !   Oh yeah , no that's that's an old message , nobody needs to hear that .  Hey umm , was was Monica here ? Yeah , I want my money back . Hey Pheebs , has Gary ever been shot at for real ? I wonder how I would react under fire , y'know ? And not backfire but but heavy fire , like I was in a war or something . I know where Joey would be . He would be down in the foxhole protecting all of us . Hey ! I just got uh , my teacher evaluations ! Check out what this one student wrote , I loved Dr . Geller s class . Mind blowing lectures ! Dr . Geller , you are definitely the hottie of the paleontology department !  Oh , I wish I knew , but the evaluations are all anonymous . Yeah . It s a girl ! Anyway , it wou it wouldn t matter . Okay ? Because I m a teacher and she s a student . No , but it is frowned upon . Besides , there s a big age difference . I know when I m 90 she ll be like 80 and it won t seem like such a big difference .  Yeah ? Oh thank you . Thanks very much .  Ow !  That was you ? Oh I , I don t I don t think that would be the best idea . What time ? Gotcha .  Oh ! So so seriously , what time ? What ?

By using CT scans and computer imaging we can in a very real way , bring the Mesozoic era into the 21st century . Oh and you know what , it will be even better tomorrow , because I won't be constantly interrupted by Joey checking to see if they put chocolates on my pillow yet .  . The chocolates aren't here yet . If you want to check your email , just ask !  Wha . . . what do you mean ?  What , oh my God . What did you do ? Why , why would you open it ? What did it say ?

Yeah , well you should ! I mean , nude pictures of Anna Kournikova ? I mean , she's never even won a major tournament ! Get out !  Well , what do you do ? I can't believe this . I can't believe this is happening . I have to give the keynote speech tomorrow ! Ok ? I have to stand up in front of all these people . What am I gonna say ? I don't think that your monologue from Star Wars is gonna help me right now , Joe ! Wha . . . what you really think we can do that ? Alright , ok , let's do it .  Uhm , I know we start by discussing the shortcomings of carbon dating . . . uhm , and then , then I move on to what is clearly the defining moment of the Mesozoic era , the breakup of Pangea , hello !  And then , there's the . . . eh . . . there's the overview of the Triassic . Yeah , that's it ? Oh my God , we did it !  Yes , but I did make a pyramid out of the bath products . This is amazing , thank you , thank you so much .  That's a pretty necklace . Hey , what do you say we celebrate ? Champagne ?  Oh my God , I love you . That's Ben , my son from my first marriage .

My wife had a workout friend she went to the gym with everyday for a year . She didn't get any fitter . I know ! It's like , if you knew , why didn't you tell me , you know ? I mean , call , or leave a note : Hi , I just dropped by to say your wife's gay  And then , you try to make the best of a bad situation , so you float the idea of a threesome ?  Me neither . Yep , we got it , we got it .  Thank you so much . Good night .  Walls are pretty thin , guys ! Then we have to await the data from recent MRI scans and DNA testing which call into question information gathered from years of simple carbon dating . Finally , factoring the profusion of new species recently discovered : Gigantosaurus , Argentinasaurus . . . And that's just the herbivores . I'm not even gonna discuss the carnivores , their heads are already too big . Which is ironic considering their stunted cerebral development . But all kidding aside , in much the same way that Homo ergaster [1 ] is now thought to be a separate species from Homo erectus . . .  . . . and while there are certainly vast differences between these Mesozoic fossiles and the example of Homo erectus . . .  . . . in a very real way we can bring the Mesozoic era into the 21st century .  Thank you ! Oh , thanks guys ! Oh !  Ok . . . now . . . now we're just holding hands !  Oh , thank you so much !  Ok ! . . . All right , thanks ! Thank you so much , you guys !  Oh , I can't tell you how much it means to me that you were here !  Ok ! . . . Uh . . . excuse me ? Yeah ? Hey !  Well . . . ?  Yeah ?

Made me feel like a rock star !  I'd better not found you naked in my hotel room !  Look , I took it too far ! Ooh , well .

Ehm . . . Her name is Emma . What do I know ? I just sell Middle Eastern food from a cart !  Oh my God ! What . . . what you working on ? Why don't you use your Thesaurus ? Watch .  Here , you ehm . . . You highlight the word you want to change . Seriously ? Well , do you wanna marry him ? Absolutely ! You'll love the feeling ! There's nothing like it ! No , I can't .

I mean , we've been accepting Leakey's dates as a given , but if they're off by even a hundred thousand years or so then you can    you can just throw most of our assumptions , you know , right in the trash .  So so what I am saying is    is is that  is that the repercussions could be huge ! I mean , not just in palaeontology , but if if you think about it , in evolutionary biology , uh , genetics , geology , uh , I mean , truly the mind boggles ! Oh , that's not what you want . . . Joey ! Hey , I need to talk to Charlie . Is she there ? I'm meeting with professor Sherman about my being the keynote speaker . . . It could be better ! He , uhm . . . he fell asleep ! Barbados . What am I supposed to do ? He's out cold ! In fact he was just talking in his sleep before and evidently he wants someone named Fran to spank him harder . I can't ! If he realizes that I'm the one that put him to sleep , I won't get the job !  Oh my God ! You really want me to be the keynote speaker ? Thank you !  Hey , you re not going to believe this . I made up a joke and sent it in to Playboy . They printed it ! Yeah , they print jokes , interviews , hard hitting journalism . It s not just about the pictures .  Here , check it out . It s the first one , too . What ? Uh , oh oh , no you didn t . I did . Hey , tell Dan ,  Thanks .  What ? Look , Chandler , it s my joke . But , hey , if it makes you feel any better they don t print the name , so it doesn t really matter who gets credit , right ? No , it s my joke , it s mine . You can call them , they ll tell you . It s my joke . You know , Barracuda was the first song I learned to play on the keyboard . What , you didn t get it ? The doctor is a monkey . Your joke ? Well , I think  the Hef  would disagree , which is why he sent me a check for one hundred ah dollars . Well , I was going to stick it in the ATM , but now I think I ll show the sexy teller that I am a published writer . Oh , what are you going to do , follow me down there ? Well , I m not going to go now anyway  .  Oh , hey , Gunther , check this out . Uh , yeah , I ll take a coffee . Thanks , man . Yeah , why would it be weird ? Hey , Joey , can I get some coffee ? Seriously , I I asked you before and you still haven t gotten it . Joey , seriously , can I get my coffee ? It s my joke . Y know , I don t think we re going to settle this . Yeah ! Hey Mon . Monica !  Yeah . Yeah , but I m your brother . We re family . That s the most important thing in the world . We ll each tell you how we came up with the joke and then you decide which one of us is telling the truth me . See , I would never snap at you like that . Are you kidding ? Okay , look . I I studied evolution . Remember , evolution ? Monkey into man ? Plus , I m a doctor , and I had a monkey . I m Doctor Monkey ! It s your joke . No way . Guys ? There's a somebody I'd like you to meet . 'That ' would be Marcel . You wanna say hi ? My friend Bethel rescued him from some lab . Yeah . I mean , it's been kinda quiet since Carol left , so . . . Nah , I dunno . . . I think you reach a certain age , having a roommate is kinda pathe     . .  sorry , that's , that's 'pathet ' , which is Sanskrit for 'really cool way to live ' . How could you not get it ? You were Santa last year . Come here , Marcel . Sit here .  Just a smidge . C'mon , this was a pact ! This was your pact ! Okay , look , he's not gonna hurt them , right ? I didn't wanna leave him alone . Alright ? We   we had our first fight this morning . I think it has to do with my working late . I said some things that I didn't mean , and he   he threw some faeces . . . Oh , that'd be great ! Okay , but if you do , make sure it seems like you're there to see him , okay , and you're not like doing it as a favour to me . So tell me something . What does the phrase 'no date pact ' mean to you ? Okay , so on our no date evening , three of you now have dates . Four . Five .  Okay , so I'm gonna be the only one standing there alone when the ball drops ? Hey , y'know , this is so not what I needed right now . Oh , it's it's Marcel . He keeps shutting me out , y'know ? He's walking around all the time dragging his hands . . . Really . What , uh . . . what juggling thing ? No . Par tay ! 'That thing ' ? This is how you greet guests at a party ? Let me ask you something , if I showed up here with my new girlfriend , she wouldn't be welcome in your home ? Okay . He was more embarrassed about that than anyone . Okay ? And for him to have the courage to walk back in here like nothing happened . . . Thank you .  C'mon , Marcel , whaddya say you and I do a little mingling ?  Alright , I'll , uh . . . catch up with you later .  Look at him . I'm not saying he has to spend the whole evening with me , but at least check in . Perfect . Perfect . So now everybody's getting kissed but me .  I wanted this to work so much . I mean I'm still in there , changing his diapers , pickin ' his fleas . . . but he's just phoning it in . Just so hard to accept the fact that something you love so much doesn't love you back . Oh yeah , let me just finish this . Have you seen this ? It's a new alumni website for college ! It's cool ! You can post messages for people , let everyone know what you're up to . It's actually kinda interesting to find out what people are doing . . . remember Andrea Rich ? Uh uh . . . well , her Internet Company went under and she lost an ear in a boating accident . . . No . . . I already e mailed her . You know what ? I'm gonna finish this later , ok ? Let me just grab my coat .  What do you think you learnt how to do in the last two minutes ? ?   Alright , let's go ! I think you made it clear you cannot be trusted with the ball inside the house !  I have sex with dinosaurs ? ? That only is not funny , it's physically impossible ! Ok ? Depending on the species I'd have to have a six foot long . . .  It's not funny ! ! I can't believe you put that on my alumni page ! You'd better hope not because I just read what you put on your page today . Oh oh oh ! I RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE ! !  I'm dead ? Posting that I died ? That really isn't funny . Oh please , hit by a blimp ? Unbelievable , my classmates are gonna think I'm dead , my professors , my . . . my parents are gonna get phone calls . You're messing with people's feelings here . You've really crossed the line here , but that's okay , it's ok 'cause I'm on my way to buy some Photoshop software and a stack of gay porn . That's right ! Your coming out is about to get real graphic . uhu uhu , check this out .  Eh  actually no , I don't need to because your little Ross is dead  joke didn't work , ok , there were no responses . Nobody posted anything on the website , nobody called my parents , so the joke my friend is on you . Nobody called , nobody wrote anything , nobody cares that I'm dead .  Oh my God ! Nobody cares that I'm dead ! ? What are you talking about ? You get sixty responses just for coming out of the closet ! I didn't get one response ! And I'm dead ! I can't believe this . Not even my geology lab partner ? And I carried that guy !  You're right . There isn't a decent outlet . Exactly ! !  No ! That would be stupid ! You're having it for me ! oh , too late , too late ! It's sent . . . oops sorry and so is the picture of you and the police man . . . It's been an hour and not one of my classmates has shown up ! I tell you , when I actually die some people are gonna get seriously haunted ! Ok , ok ! I'm gonna go hide ! Oh , this is so exciting , my first mourner !  Who is he ? I don't remember him , but then again I touched so many lives .   I'm dead and no one cares ? It isn't ridiculous , look around ! No one's here ! Yes , you're right . Still somebody must have seen it . . . I mean , I went to that school for 4 years , I didn't have an impact on anyone ?  Yeah . . .  But you didn't ! I'm still alive ! ! Kori , I know this is a big surprise for you . It's a long story but the things you just said really made my day ! I mean , the fact that you are here means more to me than if this room were filled with people ! Did you hear that ? Kori Weston had a crush on me ! !  No Mum , I'm not dead . I know it's not something to kid about . It was just a practical joke between Chandler and me , but it's over , ok ?  Actually no , even if I had died , you would not be left childless .  Monica ?  Dude , that reverse lay up ! Oh  Amazing ! Oh , you guys call him Cute Coffeehouse Guy , we call him Hums While He Pees . It s not a club . Hey , divorced men are not bad men ! Soon he ll be able to call you , that lady he knew who got fired . Maybe I should open a divorced men s club . I could put uh uh a basketball court in the back . I like this one .  It seems to say , I love you and that s why I have to kill you .  Yeah ? What ? ! No ! Look , I don t think so Pheebs .  All right , I ll do it . But just because you re a friend .  All right ! I want my key back ! It s right there !  Look , I m sorry but you you you better go Pheebs . Oh yeah No You re welcome . We ll talk about it later . Hi Whitney . Yep .  Okay .  Hi !

That s where we realized we were both super cool people ! Like what ? Okay . Fine ! Thank you for warning me . At breakfast I ll be on full alert for room painting and sex weapons . Yeah ! Pheebs come on ! I mean , consider the source ! Of course her ex husband s gonna say that stuff . Now , if you ll excuse me  Hi . Listen , you are hearing one side of the story , okay and F.Y.I she must ve shown Kyle over 30 paint samples before she painted that room ! And his response to each one was , I don t give a tiny rat s ass .  Well , I don t think we are gonna have that problem , but maybe that s just because I am not emotionally unavailable ! I think he can be . Well , excuse her for knowing what she wants to do with her life !  I knew you were gonna throw that in my face ! ! That was three years ago ! She apologized and she apologized ! What more do you want ? ! ! So do we ! ! So do we ! !  I m sorry you had to see that . My God ! Well maybe she wouldn t have to be selfish in bed if someone else knew where everything was ! Wh what s up ? Oh just say it Kyle !  Y know , he hums when he pees ! It makes him miss the bowl , but whatever . That s all right , we we don t need you . In fact , hey I m over it already .  I m sorry . Ugh , Pheebs , you were , you were right about her . Y know , she did try to use sex as a weapon ! Yeah , I hurt my back a little . Yeah , were better off without them .

Meanwhile the faucet fills the apartment with water . Baby and bird still up lays  are locked in a death grip , swirling around the whirl pool , that fills the apartment . Great .

Yeah , most of it it's a place packed with confused angry baseball fans ! Yeah , uh , uh , ok , there's this great rare bookstore on Madison Avenue . You know what ? She loves architecture , you know what you should do ? You should take a walk down fifth to the Saint Patrick's Cathedral and there there's this great little pastry shop that she'd love . But I'm not !  . You know what if you're in the mood for Thai food . . . Ok . Ok , when you walk in the museum , take the right , that's the antiquities wing . Ancient Egypt , Mesopotamia , up to the Byzantine Empire . Now , do you have any idea what you just said ? Ok now , remember , when you get to the museum , Monet is not spelt M O N A Y . I just . . . I wrote that out phonetically for you . Yeah , yeah that means . . . you know ? We just . . . we don't have time for this . Ok , but you know what ?

But still , I mean , it seems like you guys are having a great time together . What ? What , I mean , a little , but no , what , go on .  Yeah . But you know what ? I think you should give Joey a chance . I mean , he's a great guy , and sure he doesn't know that much about art but you know , you can always talk about that with someone else . And if you think about it , I mean the reason he memorized all that stuff is because he thought it was important to you . You know , that's the kind of guy Joey is . That was going to be my next argument . Hey ! Glad I could help man . Thank you . Boy , we uhm . . . hadn't really thought of that . Oh , come on Rach , we will . I promise .

Do you realise that man has cried in our apartment three times . . . ? Huh ? I haven't cried that many times since I moved in .  Okay , okay , see . . . that . . . that is the problem . He is too sensitive .   Yeah , I mean , all things that guy . . .  These are amazing ! This . . . this is exactly what I'm talking about .

Hey . . . there's sensitive . . . and there is too sensitive . Did Rachel tell you we hired a male nanny ? Oh really ? Did she tell you he plays the recorder , recites poetry and bakes Madeleines ?

You know , I'm just not uhm . . . that comfortable with a guy who's as sensitive as you . Why . . . I . . . I don't know .  Uhm . . . errrr . . . maybe . . . maybe because of my father ? I mean , uhm . . . you know when I was growing up he was kind of a tough guy . . . You know a a and as a kid I wasn't the athlete I am now . I play squash . . . ! Anyway , uhm . . . I uhm . . .

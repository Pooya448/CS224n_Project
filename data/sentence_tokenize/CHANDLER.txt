hey !
I have got nowhere to go this morning .
I am unemployed !
i do not know what I am going to do with my life .
i mean , what am i supposed to do with myself ?
but it is all so overwhelming .
i do not know where to start .
hey !
this is where your hyper organized pain in the ass stuff pays off !
how long was i in there ?
wait .
advertising !
that is a great idea !
i do not think i have to hear the rest .
advertising makes perfect sense .
sorry you had to waste all this time , though .
i mean , i can write slogans .
i mean , how hard can it be , right ?
cheese .
it is milk that you chew .
crackers .
because your cheese needs a buddy .
a grape .
because who can get a water melon in your mouth ?
honey ?
leave it to the pros .
the phone .
bringing you closer to people .
who have phones .
no , no .
but let me show you what i can do .
bagels and donuts .
round food for every mood .
really ?
that is great !
it is funny .
when you said unpaid  it sounded like you said unpaid .
actually , we are trying , and i do not think monica's going to want to postpone it .
we are supposed to have sex tonight .
actually , she is probably at home naked right now .
i tend to keep talking until somebody stops me .
i can just picture her on the bed right now .
whatever i decide to do , I am going to be starting a career from scratch .
it is going to be a while before i make a living at it .
maybe now is not the right time to be starting a family .
yeah .
yeah , ross is here so .
.
.
hey .
oh , yeah .
but you have to give it back if i get a job .
of course , by that time in the future ties will be obsolete and we will all be wearing silver jump suits .
oh god , i have to tell you something .
you are not pregnant .
that thing that i have to do to make a baby .
i faked it .
oh yes you can .
you just make the faces and the noises .
that is actually why .
look , I am starting a whole new career now , and I am not saying that i do not want to have a baby , I am just saying maybe we could wait a little while .
or a year ?
it could be less than a year .
i mean , you have heard my stuff .
pants .
like shorts , but longer .
it will probably be more than a year .
yeah , me too .
look , I will just get my old job back .
i quit and you learn what i do ?
i guess .
it is always going to be scary when we have a baby .
should we go make a baby right now before you change your mind ?
oh , and i promise , i will not fake it this time .
this is so sad .
i mean , i only have like ten pins .
y know i think we should invite them .
well this is just sad !
well , thanks a lot for hookin  me up rach .
i want you to know that i want you to attend our wedding as my guest .
well , what s the deal with these ?
these these look nice .
you mean like for award shows ?
you mean these tuxes have been down the red carpet with people yelling , you are you wearing ?
!
you look fabulous !
okay , who wore those ?
not bad .
who s that ?
pierce brosnan ?
are you serious ?
007 ?
!
this is james bond s tux ?
!
oh , i have to get married in james bond s tux !
oh , it s not just that , i would be england s most powerful weapon .
jet setting heartbreaker on her majesty s secret service .
a man who fears no one ; with a license to kill .
would monica let me wear this ?
a freakish thin date with a hanger for her head ?
what ?
you can t wear that !
i m wearing the famous tux !
james bond s tux !
so if you wear that you ll make mine less special .
please , don t take away my cool thing .
please ?
!
pretty please ?
!
look , it s my wedding day okay ?
if you were getting married i would never do anything to upset you .
that was pretty 007 .
ross is batman !
rachel got ross the tuxedo that val kilmer wore in batman .
okay batman is so much cooler than james bond !
batman has a utility belt !
batman has the batmobile !
batman has robin !
we get espn right ?
actually , i don t like martinis .
ooh , yum !
i would but mine doesn t fit .
the pants are a little tight .
well , does that mean that you re not going to wearing yours ?
let me try it on !
okay .
holy double vented comfort batman !
what s this ?
an invitation for the at first sight premiere ?
oh my god !
val kilmer didn t wear this in batman !
he wore it to the premiere of some tooty fruity love story where he played a blind guy !
the only superpower you have is a slightly heightened sense of smell .
well , you re welcome .
and tell them we re really glad they re coming .
all right !
i found one that fits !
whose is it ?
whose is it ?
oh , come on !
i don t care !
come on !
whose is it ?
hi !
man , if only you d gotten here sooner .
yeah ?
okay .
okay .
i ve been thinking about it too , and i , i think we re ready .
but you said you were ready too .
yes , but haven t you wanted a kid like forever ?
i m not crazy about babies .
i m crazy about us .
look , we ve always talked about having babies someday .
i m not saying it has to be right now , but i m starting to think that we can handle it .
we re good .
we re really good .
but nothing has to happen until your ready .
what ?
!
it s not right !
we re not ready to have a kid now !
!
i m kidding .
this is going to be fun .
we re trying to get pregnant .
y know i m not really comfortable doing this in front of the babies .
so , when do you want to start trying ?
period math ?
yeah .
right here ?
wait a minute , it s perfect .
we got a lot of time to kill and we re in a building that s full of beds !
okay .
okay .
uh , we ll dim the lights , dim the lights .
or turn them out all together .
uh , no scented candles .
okay here .
here we go .
yes , 98.6 .
you re going to be fine .
should we tell rachel there s an empty private room right next door to hers ?
well let me think about that , while i remove my pants !
if it s not , then there s two of them .
and that would mean it s the end of the world !
hi .
weirdest thing .
did i hear mother of god it s true !
jan janice !
janice i didn t even know you were pregnant !
who s the unwitting human who s essence you ve stolen ?
what ?
!
that s funny .
does it does it hurt ?
does the labor hurt ?
it s incredible , i mean one minute she s inside you and then 47 hours later here she is .
so , do you know what you re going to call her yet ?
so then i guess ferdinad is out .
you do ?
oh no , it s going to be named after some snack or baked good isn t it ?
that was amazing .
and if not , we got to do it on a bucket .
there is a hair in my coffee .
you know , it is funny .
every time you say triplets ,  i immediately think of three hot blonde 19 year olds .
so , a lot of malfunctioning wee wees and hoo hoos in this room , huh ?
i mean , you have a lovely home .
that is great .
can i see the book ?
you want me to wash my hands first , do not you ?
hey , you must be owen .
I am chandler .
hey , i was in the scouts too .
yeah , in fact my father was a den mother .
you know how to use a compass ?
you do ?
that is fantastic !
I would love to , but i got to get back to talking to your parents .
they are telling us all about how they adopted you .
what ?
i got nothing .
where are bill and colleen ?
we have to leave !
!
i did not get to the bathroom .
i bumped into owen on the way , and he did not know he was adopted .
and there is a slight chance i may have told him .
but kids are so intuitive .
do not you think on some level he already knows ?
see ?
intuitive !
which technically now you should give back !
I am so sorry , but you should have a sign out there or something .
or at least whisper it to people when they come in the door .
owen does not know he is adopted , and he also thinks that santa is real .
owen did not know he was adopted , and monica told him .
yeah , but how would you like it if someone told the triplets that you gave birth to them ?
I am going to go tell emma she was an accident .
hey !
so we thought we would throw you little going away party around seven .
where is your passport ?
well , it is not .
we are taking a break !
jumping on the bed ?
no , no , no , guys .
she is right .
we should get to work .
I will take stuff out of the closet , joey you pack  them and ross you re pack whatever joey packs .
what the hell is this ?
i did not know monica had these !
why would she use them with richard and not me ?
i can be kinky !
i once did a naked dance for her .
.
.
with scarves !
hey .
i know , she is been such a big part of my life .
and it feels like when melrose place got cancelled .
i mean .
.
.
oh , forget it .
i miss melrose place !
yes , joe ?
oh , yes .
i decided to leave these out for you in case richard stops by and you want to engage on a little light bondage and moustache play !
oh yeah , right !
good luck getting another scarf dance from me !
really ?
then what are they doing in our guestroom ?
rachel .
.
.
with handcuffs !
interesting !
.
well played .
uh , rach ?
uh , rach .
.
.
i think i have something that belongs to you .
no , no , no .
.
.
they are really yours .
we .
.
.
found them in your old room .
do not say richard !
well , if they are not monica's and they are not yours , then whose are they ?
pheebs !
i think these are yours .
sure .
you do not really handcuff guys to waterpipes do you ?
let me just say something .
.
.
because once we get into this , I am going to get all uncomfortable and probably make some stupid joke .
.
.
i just want to say that i .
.
.
i love you .
.
.
and , I am going to miss you .
and I am so sad that you are leaving .
ooh , not so tight .

I am sorry , just give me one more chance .
I am sor .
.

what exactly did he say to you ?
uh huh .
he didn t say anything about that to me .
he was asking all these questions about you , me , and london .
and , of course the glue that holds this all together , the rules .
but what did he mean by rules ?
because he was looking at her differently .
my god !
he wants to do it with phoebe in london !
you don t say anything .
i m not going to let you say anything .
oh , god !

it s a dog .
it s your parents  anniversary and you re going to talk about their dead pet ?
yeah , sure .
what do you need ?
we got lace , satin , sateen , raffia , gingham , felt ,  and i think my testacles may be in here too .

yeah .
i don t think the flash went off .
somewhere there is someone with a tranquilizer gun and a huge butterfly net looking for that man .
what are you doin  ?
ya know if you want to , i can just hold them down and you could  .
we can ?
all right , I am tryin ' that .
so , saturday night , the big night , date night , saturday night , sat ur day night !
not a one .
oh , right , right , shut up .
no , i know , but it is just so hard , you know ?
i mean , you are sitting there with her , she has no idea what is happening , and then you finally get up the courage to do it , and there is the horrible awkward moment when you have handed her the note .
oh , thanks , but i think she would feel like we are gangin ' up on her .
ooh , i hate when my father calls me that .
oh .
well , hold on camper , are you sure you have thought this thing through ?
it is just you and rachel , just the two of you ?
this is a date .
you are going on a date .
yuh huh .
well , you may want to rethink the dirty underwear .
this is basically the first time she is going to see your underwear you want it to be dirty ?
oh , and uh , the fabric softener ?
there you go .
where are they ?
where are they ?
it is great .
maybe tomorrow we can rent a car and run over some puppies .
here we go .
hey , janice .
hey , that is not good .
can i get an espresso and a latte over here , please ?
what ?
what .
.
.
did you get me there ?
bullwinkle socks .
that is so sweet .
that is great .
well , I am going to get another espresso .
can i get you another latte ?
that is it ?
oh , yeah , that hug looked pretty brutal .
janice .
hi , janice .
ok , here we go .
i do not think we should go out anymore .
janice .
here is the thing , janice .
you know , i mean , it is like we are different .
I am like the bing , bing , bing .
you are like the boom , boom ,  .
.
.
boom .
oh , my god , I am so sorry .
are you ok ?
i hit her in the eye !
i hit her in the eye !
this is the worst break up in the history of the world .
oh , i do not know , a million ?
I am fine .
I am not fine .
here she comes .
how do you do that ?
we should always always break up together .
I am free !
I am free !
monica said wedding .
do you think you could get through a poem ?
too ?
well , whatever it is , i hope it involves winking .
that s great !
so great things are happening at work and in your personal life !
don t do it .
i think it s the dying cat parade .
oh my god !
y know that thing that ross was going to do at our wedding ?
!
he was hanging out with me yesterday and he turned to me and said , you re half scottish right ?
yes !
!
why is your family ross ?
!
if you listen very carefully , i think its celebration by cool and the gang .
well , i feel like a snack !
oh no thanks .
i don t like any thing from my scottish heritage .
well it s just my entire family was run out of scotland by vikings .
anyway , lots of bad memories .
we heard you play all the way from your apartment !
that s not really important right now .
what is important is ; while we appreciate the gesture , we just don t feel bagpipes are appropriate for our wedding .
because we hate them .
we have heard you play .
ohh .
mmm .
hey , you have got to try this cheesecake .
it was at the front door .
when i got home .
somebody sent it to us .
i no !
i did not read the box before i opened it .
and you can not return a box after you have opened the box .
because it is too delicious .
no no no !
it is going to be okay , because mrs .
braverman is going to send away for a free one and that way we all win !
the only losers are the big cheesecake conglomerate ,  momma s little bakery .
i feel terrible , i m a horrible , horrible , horrible person .
so  oh , what s at 8:00 ?
well , maybe since the age of 9 , frannie s made some new friends .
i used to undress my cousin glenn .
another cheesecake came !
they delivered it to the wrong address again !
i can t seem to say goodbye .
well i ve forgotten what it tastes like okay ?
!
y know what ?
forget it !
we are just hungry !
we have not had lunch !
we are just light headed !
so let us go out and have lunch and forget about the cheesecake .
good idea .
where do you want to go to lunch ?
well , thank you for lunch .
so apparently we just don t pay for food anymore .
do you see what i see ?
mrs .
braverman must be out .
by then , the cheesecake may have gone bad .
we don t want her to come back to bad cheesecake .
well , we don t want that .
but we should take it .
why ?
go !
go !
go !
go !
go !
go !
go !
go !
go !
go !
i m full , and yet i know if i stop eating this , i ll regret it .
what are you doing tonight ?
dude !
dude !
oh really ?
uh , monica said she had a date at 9:00 .
that s what monica said .
are you eating the cheesecake without me ?
!
i will give you a hundred dollars to whistle right now .
how can you eat the cheesecake without me ?
!
y know what ?
i don t trust you with this cake anymore !
and i got it first , and i m takin  it back !
oh yes !
oh yes !
oh yes !
oh yes !
well that s not fair , you ve already had some !
what do we use to split it ?
okay well , this side looks bigger .
uh  there s more crust on this side .
y know ?
so , maybe if i measured  all right , i ll pick that one .
ohhh !
oh ho ho ho no !
no !
no switching !
no sharing , and don t come crying to me !
ha ha ha !
i may just sit here and have my cake all day !
just sit here in the hallway and eat my   stick to your side !
yeah , baby !
making chocolate milk .
do you want some ?
well , she spent the last six months getting over him , and now she s celebrating that by going on a date with him .
oh , hey .
so ah , isn t a bit cold out for shorts ?
right , right .
sometimes you guys just burst into flames .
i m up !
i m up , i ve gotten up now !
anybody ah , want anything ?
okay ross , why don t you come with me ?
robert s coming out .
no .
he .
.
.
he s coming out of his shorts .
the man is showing brain .
wellll ?
what do we do ?
what do we do ?
like an eclipse .
your liking it , huh ?
no , actually laurie s a boy .
hey .
you mean a three pointer ?
i m sorry , i m sorry , it just seems that robert isn t as concealed in the shorts area , as ah , one may have hoped .
stretchy pants !
why , those are the greatest things in the world !
if i were you i would wear them every day , every day !
hmmm , that s very cool .
i can t believe she cracked your code !
no , beth doesn t die , she doesn t die .
does she rachel ?
we can t tell him , you can t go up to a guy you barely know and talk about his .
.
.
.
stuff .
yeah , we got , um hmm .
okay , she is the star of the play .
and she is my girlfriend !
i get to have sex with the star of the play !
i know !
!
wow !
she looks great .
doesn t she ?
is it just me , or can you actually see his abs through his overcoat ?
!
yeah , it s like someone literally wrote down my worst nightmare and then charged me $32 to see it !
i m totally screwed .
okay , they are going to be hot and heavy on stage every night , and then they re going to go to their cast parties and he s going to try to undermine me .
y'know it ll be like , so where s your boyfriend , what s his name , chester ?
and she ll go , no no no , it s chandler .
and he ll go , whatever .
ha ha ha ha !
all right , look , look , what am i going to do ?
really ?
so uh , man , are you going to go to the play with me tonight ?
yeah , i know but  okay , okay , but don t worry , because we also have cereals , muffins , waffles , and , jams , jellies , and marmalades .
which i m fairly certain are the same thing .
i m right !
right ?
there was like no chemistry between them .
before they had heat , and now there s no heat !
now you know what this means , joey told us what this means !
come on , it was like cousins having sex up there !
oh , i loved the play .
you were great , and nick ditto .
clearly you re having sex with him .
oh come on , it was so obvious !
there was no chemistry between you two !
y know , i i could see how this could happen , y'know you re up there every night , you re naked , touching , kissing .
well , you can understand , given how we started .
well , that is what happened , and i don t even see you denying this !
yeah , well , don t expect that to happen anytime soon !
steps !
slut !
you will all be very happy to hear that kathy is sleeping with that guy !
i confronted her , and she didn t deny it !
i don t live here !
well , i may be drunk , but i know what she said !
then i went over to beefsteak julie s  yes !
see you and i have always been like  did she call ?
all right , maybe i should call her .
well , yeah , but y'know , what what if i was wrong ?
well y'know , what if she didn t actually sleep with the guy ?
she did not have to tell me , i saw the play , and there was no heat .
back me up here , ross !
that s not backing me up !
look , you said with the off stage and the heat , and the onstage and the oy heat .
oh my god !
!
hey .
i just , i just wanted to come over to to say that i m sorry .
y know ?
i know i acted like the biggest idiot in the world , and i can completely understand why you were so upset .
yeah , i know , i i wish i had too , but y know i i think this is a good thing .
y'know ?
because we ve had our first fight , and now we can move on .
y know , i know for me  nick s pants ?
yeah .
well , i think our second fight is going to be a big one !
well , she wasn t sleeping with him .
she is now .
i m saying that she  is a devil woman !
y know i mean you think you know someone and then they turn around and they sleep with nick !
nick , with his rock hard pecs , and his giant man nipples !
i hate him , i hate her !
well , i don t hate her , i love her .
this is all my fault really .
because , i i should ve called !
y know if i had just called her after our big , stupid fight , she never would ve gone out with nick , and they would ve ended up in bed together .
i threw her at his man nipples !
hey !
pheebs , i don t understand .
how can you have a roommate that none of us know anything about ?
hey hey !
i thought naked thursday s was just our thing man !
who was it ?
sure !
well , i like that idea .
obviously !
i was thinking maybe maybe maybe it could be a game room , y know ?
i mean you can buy old arcade games like uh , like space invaders and asteroids for $200 , the real ones !
the big big ones !
okay so you mean no as in , gee chandler , what an interesting idea .
let s discuss it before we reject it completely .
so , that s it ?
which is why asteroids is perfect !
it s the oldest game !
i don t have anything against the beautiful guest room , especially since everybody we know lives about 30 seconds away !
no , i m not mocking you ,  or you beautiful guest room .
nothing , monica and i had a stupid fight .
wanted .
female roommate , non smoker , non ugly .
nice !
hi .
hi , listen , i m sorry about before .
i don t need to have a game room .
i mean when i was a kid i only played those games because i couldn t get girls , and now i can  them now , i have you .
not not that i think that i have you or think of you as property in any sort of way , i see women  really ?
ohh .
that s a great idea !
we can easily think of a way for us both to enjoy the room .
we don t have to come up with this now .
hey , y know what ?
why don t we think about changes we can make in the living room ?
yeah , i mean we re going to have to move around some furniture to make room for my chair .
is that a problem ?
oh , that s cool .
then i ll just bring them both over .
okay , i get it .
so , i get nothing !
nothing here is mine !
everything here is yours !
i ll get up in the morning put on your clothes , and head off to work !
in the game room !
all right !
that s fine !
that s fine !
i won t bring over the chairs !
i won t bring anything over !
i wouldn t want to ruin the ambiance over here at grandma s place !
!
you can call off the roommate search !
hi !
i ll be living here .
why did you take the shower curtain down ?
well , why don t you tell her to stop being silly !
well , we are fond of the silliness , but we also have a soft spot for the love .
that s laughter .
i don t know .
yeah , i do .
he s being silly , because he knows that we enjoy the silliness !
yeah , I am not so worried .
of course !
scared me out of ever wanting to live with him .
okay !
oh my god !
someone s killed square man !
oh that s so sweet !
i want to show you something too !
y know those big big uh , road signs that say merge ?
y know ?
so i was thinking that we could get one of those signs and hang it over our bed .
because , that s you and i together !
merge !
really ?
!
hey !
hey hey hey .
so what happened ?
a forest tick you off ?
yeah !
you re building a post office ?
okay .
my word !
those are snug .
does anyone else think david copperfield is cute ?
all right , janice , likes him .
in fact she likes him so much she put him on her freebie list .
well , we have a deal , where we each get to pick five celebrities that we can sleep with , and the other one can t get mad .
ah , kim basinger , cindy crawford , halle berry , yasmine bleeth , and ah , jessica rabbit .
i know , i know , i just always wondered if i could get her eyes to pop out of her head .
peter parker .
what a geek !
hi .
we don t , really .
you know , we don t really take advantage of living in the city .
no , you didn t get me !
!
it s an electric drill , you get me , you kill me !
!
i do not want this unit !
!
fine !
all right , so who do you got it narrowed down to ?
oooh hoo , very attractive , forgiving .
eh , y'know what , she s to political , she probably wouldn t let you do it , unless you donated four cans of food first .
ooh hoo .
very hot , very sexy .
but ah , y'know she s too international , y'know she s never going to be around .
so , you got to play the odds , pick somebody who s going to be in the country like all the time .
have you seen joey ?
oh , just this !
y know what it s my fault really , because the couch is usually where we keep the varnish .
what s going on ?
yo !
!
spackel boy !
get up !
he started mine first !
what , like a number ?
hi !
bye !
okay , on three .

why two ?
yeah , i coulda counted to three like four times without all this  two  talk .
okay , one .
two .
.
.
oh , good job joe .
yeah yeah , so big that it actually makes our doors look smaller !
yeah , y'know what i got a better idea .

oh my god !
you do know that wham broke up ?
where is emily ?

and i love the milk !
but , i m not going to some british girl to move in with me !
joey , you say things now .
okay , no problem , just remember to wake us up before you go go .
no thank you .
look , i want those basketball seats as much as you do !
okay , but we can t leave in the small apartment after we ve lived here !
didn t you ever read flowers for algernon ?
look , the only way i will even consider this is if they offer a lot more than just season seats .
screw the knicks !
i didn t mean that .
i just meant that the apartment is worth so much more .
and the knicks rule all .
no .
no .
we re not going to do that , y know why ?
because its not an even trade .
no !
op , op , i m convinced !
all right , but you can t use that again for a whole year .
i m in .
okay !
fine , let s do it .
okay , you guys uh , you guys pick first that s a low one !
why are you screaming and hugging ?
yeah baby !
tickets please !
that s courtside baby !
no they didn t !
those were like the best seats ever .
oh yeah , that s very nice .
plus , y know they were free and they re too small .
oh .
oh , god !
i know !
!
!
open up !
open up !
open up !
what the hell is going on ?
!
we are switching back , right now !
well , you re going to have to leave sometime , because you both have jobs , and as soon as you do , we re switching it back !
there s nothing you can do to stop us !
right , joe ?
what ?
i don t care , this is our apartment !
and they stole you stole it our apartment , and we won that apartment fair and square , twice !
and i am getting it back right now .
i m getting back right now !
oh no no no , no more offers .
you can t offer anything to us !
totally worth it !
good night .
okay !
oh , well , that s great !
yeah .
hey , here is an idea , why do not we use our wedding china today ?
honey , she keeps canceling on us , take the hint .
what is the point of having them if we never use them ?
i will explain it to her .
muskogee !
that is like four hours from tulsa .
woo hoo !
are not you one of the stars of the popular daytime soap days of our lives ?
what are you going to do ?
well you proved them wrong .
I will tell you what , for the rest of our lives , I will be careful until told otherwise .
<looks at china > hey wait a minute this is not the china we picked out .
.
why ?
oh suddenly , flowers are feminine ?
i can not believe you would want us to raise emma .
you know , guys i got to say .
this means so much to me .
that you would trust me with your child .
i mean , we all know that monica and i have been trying to have a baby of our own .
you know I have had my doubts about my skills as a father , but that you two .
.
that you two .
.
.
.
<starts to cry > no , if crazy plate lad .
.
<sees monica frustrated at this comment > if monica dies then i would get emma , right ?
actually what ?
what ?
so if monica's not around , then I am not good enough to raise emma ?
well what is wrong with me ?
am i  .
.
am i incomptent ?
because i managed to survive whatever it is that killed the three of you !
look , i may not know a lot about babies , but do you really think I am not capable ?
ok .
so if we both had emma and i die <knocks on table >  she would have to give her up .
so .
.
let me get this straight .
so my two friends die , i get emma .
then my wife dies , then emma the one tiny ray of hope left in my life gets taken away from me ?
oh ?
did somebody miss me ?
is there a child to raise poorly ?
yeah but they are right .
i mean , I am not a strong father figure and i never will be .
yeah , but its not who i am .
everything they said was exaclty why i was worried about having a kid .
and its true .
and look everybody knows it .
oh yeah , well can you picture me saying go to your room !
you are grounded  ?
you said that to me last week .
oh no that is okay , you are totally right .
i do not know anything about disciplining a child .
but it did hurt my feelings and i want you to know that when i die , you do not get joey .
alright !
that is it .
this is our apartment and you can not behave this way .
now if you can not act your age then you should not be here at all .
now those plates may not be as nice as the pretty pink ones i picked out , but they are very important to monica .
i want you to apologize to her right now .
okay .
that is better .
now i want you to both apologize to each other and mean it .
by the way , that fight was totally arousing .
oh yeah ?
well thanks .
okay , but you should know he eats five times a day and shoves pennies up his nose .
oh no no no .
.
I will get her .
I am super compentent and totally responsibile and fourth in line to raise emma .
I will be right there emma .
just let me get my trusty diaper bag here .
<knocks over the box of china > well .
.
what do you know ?
i guess , I will be the one who dies first .
nope .
.
.
yep .
.
.
nope .
.
.
hey .
.
.
so I am going to .
.
.
put the plates back .
you know , i think you were right , i do not think we should use these plates again for a looong time .
maybe not even then .
wow , what a geek .
they spent $69.95 on a wonder mop .
well , that is what we said about joey .
.
.
how about joey .
.
.

she is not going to make you wear one of those big plastic cones , is she ?
so what does this mean ?
i do not get it , i mean , you just got him .
how can he be an adult already ?
i know that one !
.

yeah , but that is like two blocks away from the beach .
i mean , it is a total party zoo .

y'know , you would think i would have .

what if me eyes are closed , and , and my hand is out there .
.
.
.

that was one of the worse things ever .
and not just on tv .
and say nothing ?
no no no no .
hey !
hi sweetie .
so , what was with all the whispering ?
secret ?
married people aren t supposed to have secrets between one another .
we have too much love and respect for one another .
no i m serious , we should tell each other everything .
i do not have any secrets from you .
oh no no , i can t do that .
okay .
so , ross and i are going to disneyland and we stop at this restaurant for tacos .
and when i say restaurant , i mean a guy , a hibachi , and the trunk of his car .
so ross has about 10 tacos .
and anyway , we re on space mountain and ross starts to feel a little iffy .
no , he visited a little town south of throw up .
so what was phoebe s secret ?
that s it ?
!
i gave up my disneyland story for that ?

nancy thompson s getting fired !
i had too okay ?
!
we re getting married !
married couples can t keep secrets from one another !
du ude !
did you not hear me say , du ude ?
!
in my defense , it was dark and he was a very pretty guy .
ho ho , so hard we had to throw out your underwear again ?
you want to tell secrets ?
!
okay !
okay !
in college , ross used to wear leg warmers !
ross came in forth and cried !
of course it is .
wow whoa !
hey !
!
!
that was you !
you have no trouble telling time now right ?
quick !
what time is it ?
!
y know when i said that because we re getting married that we should share everything and not have any secrets ?
yeah that was stupid .
let s not do that .
yeah , and not that you would , but i wouldn t hang out with all the guys in my office .
oh my goodness !
where did you hide it ?
pheebs you didn t have to get us anything for our wedding you already sang  oh , okay .
i kind of like it here .
well what did it do ?
a vending machine ?
who cares ?
it s a stupid game .
i don t suck .
it s sucks .
you suck .
why do you want to play this game so bad ?
you are not going to believe what i did today !
i got good .
i played this game all day and now i rule at it !
they should change the name of it to ms .
chandler .
although i i hope they don t .
uh huh , and i got all the top ten scores , i erased phoebe off the board !
high five !
well i ve been playing it for like eight hours , it ll loosen up .
come on , check out the scores .
oh , and also look at the initials , they re dirty words .
because it s awesome .
well y know , they only give you three letters , so after a s s it is a bit of a challenge .
it is when you put it together with that one .
come on , he won t even know what they mean .
have you talked to him lately ?
no no no , if you unplug it , i ll have nothing to show for my day !
it would be like i was at work .
no !
hey look at that !
look at that , it s still there !
this thing must have some kind of primitive rom  chip in it or something !
with the claw ?
!
pull my finger my hand is messed up .
i did .
but it came at a price .
oh come on , by age seven kids have already seen orgies .
was it just me ?
!
one more score to go !
you can do it !
all right !
go left !
go left !
go right !
!
go right !
!
okay !
listen , i m going to be moving out so you will be in charge of paying the rent .
first of the month .
no , just the months you actually want to live here .
okay , here is the phone bill .
that s our phone number .
now look , i know i kind of sprung this whole me moving out on thing , so why don t i just why don t i just cover you for a while ?
it s not charity , joe  okay uh , here s the electric bill .
uh , yeah .
so , we ll do the rest of the bills later then ?
no , i hope not !
i tried to offer him some money , but he wouldn t take it .
i figure that $1,500 would cover him for a few months , y know ?
but i have to trick him into taking it so i won t hurt his pride .
well that would help the pride thing .
hey !
wow !
you look great !
want to move in with me tomorrow ?
okay !
so , what do you girls have planned for tonight ?
hey !
well , instead of just hanging out , we figure we d do nothing .
oh nope , i i have plans with joey .
yes , but for the last time .
he s at a dinner party .
oh , i wish i d know you were going to do that , i ordered chinese .
say , joe , i had a strange idea of what we could do for our last night .
what do you say we play a little uh , foosball for money ?
yes it would .
what do you say to $50 ?
okay , let s play !
the big game , italy vs .
china , apparently .
okay , give me a chance to win my money back .
okay ?
sudden death , one goal , $1,000 .
oh yes !
okay .
no !
no !
no !
no one can beat me .
see ?
now , that s why only the little fake men are supposed to do all the kicking .
still broken ?
well , there are other ways of winning back your money , how about a little uh , a little blackjack ?
okay , uh , how about , how about y know what ?
we could play a new game .
a new game , it s fun .
cups .
i ll teach ya !
come on , come on , it s really easy and really , really fun .
okay , here you go .
i have two queens , what do you have ?
ho ho , you win !
50 dollars !
oh yeah !
okay , let s play again .
what do you got ?
you re kidding right ?
well that s a full cup !
you win .
it doesn t matter because nothing beats a three and a six .
that my friend is d cup .
okay , now much have you won so far ?
not 700 exactly ?
double it !
well you see in cups , once you get $700 , you have to double it .
hey , i didn t make up the rules .
now , after you receive the doubling bonus , you get uh , one card .
now that one card could be worth $100 bringing your total to 1,500 .
don t get to excited because that s not going to happen unless you get no way !
what s wrong ?
wh how did you lose at cups ?
!
oh man !
!
all right , let s play one more hand !
one more !
i can t take the big white dog !
you love it !
no , but wait what if i bought it from you , y know ?
and your nice gesture would be giving it to me at a reasonable price , say  $1,500 ?
when did i try to give you money ?
i m just trying to help you out !
okay ?
i want to make sure that you re okay .
hey .
i know .
no problem roomie .
sure !
i invented the game of cups as a way to give joey money .
exactly .
it s not a real game !
i made it up !
at a fake game !
!
okay !
now i assume the saucer card came up when you played last .
hmm , let s see if it comes up this time .
say goodbye elves , I am off to tulsa .
yeah , we have all this paperwork that needs to be filed by the end of the year .
if i do not get it done , I will be fired .
so , who does ?
I am sorry , i will not be here .
thanks .
I will see you new year's day .
did i not mention that ?
and to all a good night !

fine , I will give the suit back .
santa ?

.
.
just below me .
be low me !
well , she .
.
.
she did not win .
.
.

.
.
honey , there is really nothing to worry about .
I am serious !
merry christmas .
merry christmas , you guys !
the wife says hi !
.
ah well , she is got this weird idea , that , uh , y'know , just because you and i are alone , that something is going to happen .
this is probably the wrong thing to be worrying about , but .
.
.
you are getting ham on my only tie .
whoa ho , back off , missy !
i do not know ; I am not used to girls making passes at me !
.
.
.
wait a minute .
.
.
am i sexy in oklahoma ?
no , .
.
.
no .
.
.
no !
look , I am , I am married !
I am *happily * married .
right .
so , I am sorry .
.
.
well look , it is not easy to spend this much time apart , you know .
she is entitled to be a little paranoid .
.
.
or , in this case : right on money !
.
.
.
you know , she is amazing , and beautiful , and smart , and if she were here right now ,  .
she would kick your ass .
look , you are a really nice person .
.
.
ham stealing and adultery aside .
but , what i have with my wife is pretty great , so nothing is ever going to happen between us .
i mean , you were the most beautiful woman in the room tonight !
you kidding ?
you are the most beautiful woman in most rooms .
.
.
whoa !
whoa !
whoa !
what is going on ?
you and i just made out !
you and i are making out ?
but we do not do that .
how drunk are you ?
that is the perfect amount !
what ?
i know .
well , i have kissed over four women .
do you want to get under the covers ?
okay !
it bodes well for me that speed impresses you .
yep !
count of three ?
two !
well i think it is safe to say that our friendship is effectively ruined .
eh !
so , are you really going to go out with that nurse man ?
y'know , i do not know if you have ever looked up the term goofing around in the dictionary .
.
.
well , i have , and the technical definition is , two friends who care a lot about each other and have amazing sex and just want to spend more time together .
but if you have this new fangled dictionary that gets you made at me , then we have to , y'know , get you my original dictionary .
i am *so * bad at this .
really ?
okay , so .
.
.
y'know , i sensed that i should stop .
so we are okay ?
right !
okay , all right , all right , all right !
okay !
okay , here is something , here is something blue and new .
let us go !
oh , okay , i have condom in my wallet that I have had since i was twelve .
i do not think so .
here just .
take this .
no , we will we will bring it back !
just put it under your dress .
okay , one thing at a time .
ehh .
look , i thought about it too , and I am sorry .
i think we should spend all of the money on the wedding .
yeah , I am putting my foot down .
yeah look , when i proposed i told you that i would do anything to make you happy , and if having the perfect wedding makes you happy , then , then that is what we are going to do .
eh , forget about the future and stuff !
so we only have two kids , y'know ?
we will pick our favorite and that one will get to go to college .
yeah .
uh , four , a boy , twin girls and another boy .
well , stuff like where we would live , y'know ?
like a small place outside the city , where our kids could learn to ride their bikes and stuff .
y'know , we could have a cat that had a bell on its collar and we could hear it every time it ran through the little kitty door .
of course , we would have an apartment over the garage where joey could grow old .
sure you do .
you sure ?
i love you so much .
hey !
i wanted to be with you .
i missed you so much .
monica .
i never want to leave you again !
turns out they can not fire me .

it is a stupid job , and i could not stand leaving you .
and why should i be the only one who does not get to do what he *really * wants to do ?
i have *not * thought this through !
i know , i , i should have talked to you first about it .
thanks !
ahh .

i think you repaired a lot of the damage from when they met joey .
and doug wants us to play tennis with them .
he is never even talked to me outside of work .
except for that time when we bumped into each other at that strip club .
strip church .
anyway , I am going to go try and find a racquet .
oh i used too , but then joey thought it would be fun to go to central park and hit rocks at bigger rocks .
hey rach , do you have a tennis racquet ?
okay , good luck with that .
okay , easy martina .
i think we should let them win the next game .
let them win one .
you are not even giving them a chance !
oh yes , sir !
put me out of my misery .
are you sure you never played pro ?
please let them win !
oopsey , missed it !

it was my racquet .
if we had not lost the game they never would have invented us to dinner tomorrow night .

just a little bit of sugar .
oh , you get used to it .

i want to make sure it s perfect .
i can t do that .
okay and he hasn t proposed yet because she has no ring on her finger .

where the hell is everybody ?
oh yes , god yes !
!
i .
.
.
i do not know .
.
.
you seem lovely .
so , how did you enjoy the play ?
well you should be .
you missed the most powerful three hours in the history of the theater .
oh yeah !
i mean at first i hated it , but why would not i , because as a man I have been trained  not to listen !
but after chapter 16 : fat , single and ready to mingle  , i was uplifted .
oh yeah , i had no idea the amazing journey you go through as a woman !
tell me , tell me about your first period !
did somebody sign your bra ?

why haven t you told them ?
!
wouldn t they be happy ?
!
why wouldn t they be happy ?
what ?
what ?
why ?
!
is this why they don t like me or why you don t like me ?
y know , it ll be okay .
it ll be okay .
because when they come over , i will be all charming , i will make them fall in love with me , and then we ll tell  them .
hey , i can be pretty charming , babe , i won you over , didn t i ?
hey !
oh , good , ross !
you re parents like me , right ?
well monica just told me that they don t .
do you know why ?
well if people don t know they shouldn t just guess !
this is great , another thanksgiving with nothing to give thanks for .
maybe i could give thanks by taking my playstation over to my new apartment .
[mocks that last comment ] .
hey .
mr .
and mrs .
geller , you look wonderful , it is great to have you hear , let us take off your coats !
whoa , snowing out there ?
yeah , ross sure is a great guy , y know i ve always felt that how a young man turns out is a reflection on his father .
he s the headliner of a gay burlesque show .
oh , yes .
well it s very beautiful .
it s cream colored and tight [realizes what he just said and looks worried .
monica and ross also looked shocked .
judy and jack give chandler a very dirty look . ]
i don t mean tight , i mean it s not too tight , not that i was looking at  [giving up all hope , he puts his head into his hands . ]
what ?
you do ?
why ?
what ?
!
why did you do that ?
how could it not matter ?
!
what about all that  friends forever  stuff ?
your parents caught ross smoking pot in college and he blamed it on me !
the reason we haven t told them we re together is because they hate me , okay ?
so will you fix this ?
yeah , i m not going to pay for those acting classes anymore .
yeah , this is so good , that i m going to go enjoy it on the balcony so that i can enjoy the view whilst i enjoy my dessert .
yes , but if it s any consolation , before the bird dropped it , he seemed to enjoy it .
thank you !
i ll talk to them !
are not you supposed to be at an audition for another hour ?
sorry .
hello !
yeah , just some 9 year old filipino kids who worked their fingers bloody for 12 cents an hour .
that did not happen , i made that up !
okay , but do not you think this is a little extreme ?
yeah i know , we are losing ross , joey said hence  you are on in 5 ms .
minnelli .
so you are really okay with this ?
now that is so funny , because last christmas i got the gift of space .
we should get them together and make a continuum .
okay , what is in here ?
rocks ?
so , rocks .
look , we just think that maybe she is being a little unreasonable .
kind of ?
if you just kept this to yourself none of this would have happened .
well , i think it is very brave what you said .
pheebs , what are you doing with the coat ?
how about the whole animal rights thing ?
uh , ross ?
yeah , we are so sorry .
hi !
oh yeah , there there she is !
and we are done with the chicken fried rice .
or we can do the actual telephone thing .
hello children !
hey .
really ?
well , i try to y'know , squeeze things .
are you okay ?
phoebe , it is me .
you can tell me anything .
what is going on ?
well , my grandfather was swedish and my grandmother was actually a tiny little bunny .
y'know that is a popular opinion today i must say .
the weirdest thing happened at the coffee house , i think , i think phoebe was hitting on me .
I am telling you i think phoebe thinks I am foxy .
ow !
oh , y'know i i can not hear that enough .
no , i did not misunderstand , okay ?
she was all over me !
she touched my bicep for crying out loud !
well it is not flexed right now !
sure , I will do it with ya .
that new mountain bike ?
your work makes me sad .
okay , did you see that ?
!
with the inappropriate and the pinching !
!
okay , so now do you believe that she is attracted to me ?
are you serious ?
okay but what about y'know my pinchable butt and my bulging biceps she knows !
joey !
phoebe knows about us !
oh man !
ahh yes , the messers become the messies !
hello phoebe , I have been thinking about you all day .
well you know that thing you said before , I would be lying if i said i was not intrigued .
yeah , listen , joey is not going to be here tonight so why do not you come over and I will let you uh , feel my bicep .
or maybe more .
oh yeah , they are totally going to back down !

phoebe .

toootal chick flick .
they are still just friends , right ?
i can not believe we are even having this discussion .
i mean , do not you think if things were going to happen with rachel , they would have happened already ?
i can not remember the last time i got a girl to take care of my monkey .
hey , y'know what you should do ?
you should take her back to the 1890's , when that phrase was last used .
rachel lost marcel .
okay , it is his first time out , so he is probably going to want to do some of the touristy things .
I will go to cats , you go to the russian tea room .
marcel ?
marcel ?
um , we are kind of having an emergency and we we were looking for something .
.
.

and they are very hot .
okay , from now on , you do not get to talk to other people .
marcel ?

mr .

third wife sold separately .
life sized imperial storm troopers from sharper image ?

is there any chance you didn t see that ?
ross !
you got to stop !
okay ?

you can t just stare through the peep hole for three hours !

phoebe found your pregnancy test in the trash .
then who did ?
how did the job stuff go ?
or facing a bitch of a commute .
my boss said i might be getting a new lamp in my cubicle .
well , it makes me feel sad , but .
.
.
i see .
is this the best way to use one of your three magic wishes ?
we close escrow tomorrow , so seeing another house can only confuse us , and we are easily confused .
we are not very bright .
what do you think pheebs ?
yeah .
you are kidding !
oh yeah ?
i know .
*he * always wanted to be the first black man to cross the atlantic .
unless snoopy says it to charlie brown , i think we are okay .
it feels like we re cheating on our house .
and if we re going to cheat , shouldn t it be with like a hot , younger house , that does stuff that our house won t do ?
and yet i never run into beyonce !
do not , do not !
why !
?
this can not be happening !
the only way that that is going to happen , is if the other couple are the hitlers .
that is a great idea !
and by the way , i do not mean to sound distasteful , but when did you start crapping money !
?
alright alright , we still have three hours till escrow closes on our house .
we can still get out .
will we love it so much with her next door ?
and she is going to be louder out here too .
just the crickets and  oh my god  !
well , we have to do something .
we can not have her living next door .
oh , that does it too .
the hitlers will be so disappointed .
wait !
i just want you to know that .
.
.
I am so happy you are going to be here .
because .
.
.
that way .
.
.
we can pick up where we left off .
i never stopped loving you .
yeah , yeah , yeah !
i want you .
.
.
i need you .
.
.
i must have you janice litman goralnik neihosenstein .
now that you live next door , we can be together every day .

obviously .
do not say that .
do not tangle the dream and take it away .
i understand .
they are never coming down now .
tell me what ?
oh , come on tell me .
i could use another reason why women will not look at me .
wow !
more importantly , was i any good ?
interesting , because in my dreams , I am allways surprisingly inadequate .
you are okay there ?
I am sorry , it was a one time thing .
i was very drunk and i was somebody else's subconscious .

!
why ?
okay ?
why ?
wh wh why did that have to happen ?

there there was touching of things .
i don t want him to tell this story for years .
if that is your father calling to tell this story then the marriage is off !
all right , i m off to see your dad .
look , i figured i would try to convince him not to tell the story anymore , and i figure the best way to do that is face to face and by face i don t mean his lap .
and by face , i don t mean my ass .
so you understand , i d feel a lot more comfortable if you didn t tell people what happened .
y know , i m a little i m a little embarrassed about it .
what did you do when they found out ?
so i guess we wear swimsuits in here !
yeah , because if i was at my old job we would say 300 million ?

it s perfect .
it s everything we ve been looking for .

not until it is a hundred percent .
i mean , why upset everybody over nothing .
i know .
gooooood luck with it .
hey !
is it me , or have the greetings gone downhill around here ?
yeah  I am not having an affair .
nancy is our realtor .

actually , we already found a house we love .

i know this is really hard and we are really sorry .
you know that is not the reason joe .

i love her .
okay , I am in love with her .
hey .
i know .
no problem roomie .
sure !
little toast here .
i know this is not exactly the kind of thanksgiving that all of you all planned , but for me , this has been really great , you know , i think because it did not involve divorce or projectile vomiting .
anyway , i was just thinking , i mean , if you would gone to vail , and if you guys'd been with your family , if you did not have syphilis and stuff , we would not be all together , you know ?
so i guess what I am trying to say is that I am very thankful that all of your thanksgivings sucked .
here , here !
hello ?
it is nancy , they responded to our offer .
okay , thanks .
.
.
they passed .
they said they would not go a penny under the asking price .

i can t believe that i ve only got two hours before i call in sick for work .
well , you re not going to believe this , but if you have seven minutes  do you want to ?
did you see our bank statement ?
can this be right ?
I am not sure what they did , but I am inclined to blame enron .
maybe i should quit and get a job that pays .
you know what ?
you know what ?
i think we are making too big a deal out of this .
ok ?
so we pay our bills a little late this month and maybe next month we cut back on a few things .
and maybe we start eating out of joey's refrigerator for a change .
you are chef .
.
.
what can you make out of backing soda and beer ?
no !
we are not borrowing money .
because we do not do that .
we are bings !
and if there is one thing my father taught me was .
.
.
well to always knock before going into the pool house .
.
.
but the other thing was never borrow money .
that is right !
i do !
and I am your man .
and I am going to get us through this situation even if it means you working twice as hard .
yeah .
.
.
.
she is not so cute .
yes dear .
hey joe !
listen er  i need to ask you a favor but you can not tell monica anything about it .
and that would have made the official party line .
monica and i are having a little financial trouble .
what ?
what do you mean you know ?
oh !
right .
anyway , err .
.
.
i need to borrow some money .
yes !
two thousand dollars exactly !
how do you know that !
oh ok .

what would she get for herself for two thousand dollars that she would not tell me about ?
hey rach !

i just love the way you look , i am warm , for your form .
well yes yes .
.
.
you look nice can mean that your face looks nice .
i want to compliment your body .

do not answer that .
hey rach !
ah .
.

?
alright look , if it means that much to you , a may be able to get on more with the big boobs .
but the giant ass and the big clown feet ?
what ?
well !
we er  climbed up four flights of stairs , manueveored a narrow hallway , dodged a rabid pitbul .
.
.
but these last three feet are where it gets really tricky .
aaaaand .

.
.
.
.
.
hernia .
ah , look on the bright side , i mean you will not have to live with this ugly chair !
that was here already huh ?
i love you .

although it was not so much a book as a .
.
.
napkin .
with janice's phone number on it .
hey honey !

oh , then I will tell you .
my agency was bidding for a big account and they got it !

all the ideas were mine !
!
!
oh .
.
.
i do not know , i really do not think you are right for the part .
first of all .
bravo .
uh , but i really do not think you are right for this .
the part calls for a stuffy college professor .
software that facilitates inter business networking e solutions ?
hey you guys .
joe , i told you , you are just not right for the part .
joe .
.
.
fine !
work , joe !
he is not right for the part .
so if i suggest him , my bosses are going to think I am an idiot !
and that is something they should learn on their own !
that is good !
i liked it , they did not .
joey , for god's sake , go to work !
.
hey joe !
bad news .
i watched the tape and passed it along to my bosses and they were not interested .
I am sorry man .
yeah !
i .
.

i .
.
.
i liked it !
but , ehm .

of course i did !
I am not lying to you , i watched it !
i watched it !

tone ) no !
i can not believe joey .
i hate being called a liar !
what did i just say ?
yes , and i have to say , i am not just hurt .
i am insulted .
when i tell somebody i did something .
.
.
why are you so sure i did not watch this tape ?
he really is a chameleon .
look , I am sorry i did not give them your tape .
and i promise , next time to submit you whether i think you are right for the part or not .
i know .
you are right .
what is it going to take for you to forgive me ?
lying is wrong !
I am a pretty little girl .
no way !
yes , yes , we did , thanks to vidal buffay .
ok , i think she is trying to tell us something .
quick , get the verbs .

so what the hell happened to you in china ?
i mean , when last we left you , you were totally in love with , you know .
god ?
well , maybe it was god , doing me .
well , you owe me one , big guy .
he said .
he said , he said that they are having a great time .
I am sorry .
but , the silver lining , if you want to see it , is that he made the decision all by himself !
without any outside help whatsoever .
you have to really want to see it .
hi .
anybody know a good tailor ?
no , no , I am just looking for a man to draw on me with chalk .
okay .
you have to stop the q tip when there is resistance !
ok , i do not care what you guys say , something is bothering her .
what stupid thing did you do ?
people do stupid things when they are upset .
well , in spite of the yummy bagels and palpable tension , I have got pants that need to be altered .
are you sure he is going to be able to crack that code ?
at least as long as i have the pants .
yo , paisan !
can i talk to you for a sec ?
your tailor is a very bad man !
joey's tailor .
took advantage of me .
oh come on !
he said he was going to do my inseam , and he ran his hand up my leg , and then , there was definite .
.
.
cupping .

that is the beauty of this game .
it makes you want to kill yourself .
okay , but if you can not no dinner !
sure , and joey ; do not let ross look at any of the maps or the globe in your apartment .
i do not know .
maybe it is because it smells a little weird .
it is like old pumpkins or something .
which smells delicious !
what ?
tell her , I am allergic , and i will sue !
huh !
where is the dog ?
!
phoebe , we can hear the dog barking !
what is it doing here ?
extremely allergic , okay ?
if I am anywhere near a dog for more than 5 minutes , my throat will just close up !
really ?
well , it still has to go , right ?
okay , it is um   i have to !
okay ?
it is time !
okay , i hate dogs .
they are needy , they are jumpy , and you can not tell what they are thinking , and that scares me a little bit .
is there a puppy here ?
okay , you are new !
okay , it is just that dogs make me a little uncomfortable .
and i do not want to say this , i do not you guys to hate me , but uh , i do not think , i can be around that dog anymore .
okay , so either the dog goes , or i go .
oh my god !
!
here i am .
how did you know ?
where is monica ?
why not ?
well , i , i should go in there .
why not ?
this is ridiculous .
monica's all upset , because i sent clunkers away .
yeah , i can be a hero , i could do that .
i could , i could do .
.
.
i , w w what if , what if it attacks me ?
and that does not scare you ?
no , no he went for a walk .
please , please , please , do not be mad at me .
okay , i went over to ross ' apartment to bring back clunkers .
y know , for you , and  i left the door open and she must have gotten out and i looked everywhere , all over the apartment , including the roof , which fyi ross , one of your neighbors , growing weed .
i could not find him , and i am so , so , so , sorry .
but i do know where we could all go ease the pain .
clunkers ?

hey , how about maroon ?
oh that is so cool !
why would a cop come in here though ?
they do not serve donuts .
y'know what actually , could you discover the badge again ?
i think i can come up with something better than that .
hey !
oh , y'know what ?
the last time joey went to a meadow , his mother was shot by a hunter .
okay , but impersonating a police officer is a serious thing .
you could get arrested .
hi , joe .
oh , come on !
you have been acting strange all day !
whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa what what if martin luther king had said that ?
i kind of have a dream !
i don t want to talk about it .

joey , look , are you attracted to monica ?
right here , right now , are you attracted to her ?
well there you have it !
well y'know , monica and i were friends before we started dating .
so maybe maybe that is it ?

it was like torture !
it just keeps getting worse and worse !
y'know ?
i mean it s bad enough that i m in love with my roommates girlfriend which by the way , i think she knows .
because every time we re in the room together there s this weird like energy between us .
and call me crazy , but i think she likes me too .
and now i have seen her naked .

so things didn t work out with kathy , huh ?
bummer .

i spent eight hours calling him last night , just trying to get him to talk to me .
hey , by any chance did either of pick uh rachel for your secret santa ,  because i want to trade for her .
wow !
why do you want to get rid of her so badly ?
oh that s not true !

i got her that backpack and she loved it !
i remember how much she was crying the day when that big dog ran off with it   oh , there was no big dog .
all right this sucks !
i already got her this briefcase , and i had r.g .
put on it   her initials  op , y'know what though , it s kind ve a girlie briefcase .
hey , what time is it ?
the big game is about to start !
thanks .
monica got ice in her eye , and it hurts .
well maybe you should put some ice on it .
he s really picky about his patients .
all right !
okay !
i think i am making some progress with joey , when i went into the apartment he went straight into his bedroom but he only slammed the door once !
i mean yeah , he gave me the finger while doing it .
oh y know what , i was already trying to trade for ah , well , you .
i don t know r.g .
, i was thinking something girlie for your office .
oh no no no , you don t want to do that , then you re going to get stuck with rachel and she exchanges every gift she ever gets .
like ?
when was the last time you saw her wear it ?
big dog ?
i walk into a room and he won t even talk to me , he just mumbles something in italian .
and i know he only knows the bad words .
hey joe .
hey !
i m sorry !
that  where are you going ?
oh , uh , when when are you coming back ?

okay , they have had a very difficult year !
what with the robbery and all !
what ?
all right , wait !
come on !
just wait one second !
there has to be something that i can do !
something !
if we still had that entertainment unit i would get in it for six hours and think about how i let you down .
what ?
sounds like a really bad idea to me .
the meaning of the box is three fold .
one  , it gives me the time to think about what i did .
two  , it proves how much i care about my friendship with joey .
and three  , it hurts !
air hole !
air hole !
!
how do ya do .

carol ?
i was just wondering if joey could ask you a question about breast feeding ?
so , uh , how often can you do it ?
hey , sweetums .
come on , you are going to bloomingdale's with julie ?
that is like cheating on rachel in her house of worship .
what did you just do ?
what did you just do ?
of course the packaging does appeal to grown ups and kids alike .
how do you .
well , maybe it is because of the way you are dressed .
what do you care ?
you are an actor .
this is your day job .
this is not supposed to mean anything to you .
all right , say you do that .
you know sooner or later somebody is going to come along that slices a better cheddar .
and then where are you going to run ?
you are damn right I am right .
i say you show this guy what you are made of .
i say you stand your ground .
i say you show him that you are the baddest hombre west of the lingerie .
all right .
now go see miss kitty and she will fix you up with a nice hooker .
if i was a superhero who could fly and be invisible , that would be the best .
don t look honey .
change the channel !
change the channel !
what a wank !
i ll go .
see , that s why i could never be an actor .
because i can t say gig .
knock , knock .
hey , i m going for sushi does anybody want .
.
whoa whoa , somebody missed the off ramp .
okay .
it s a racecar .

that is what you heard ?
you said that ?
because I am very happy for him !
and you , you lucky dog !
yes !
hey , monica ?
can i ask you a cooking question ?
if you are cooking on the stove , does that mean that your new secret boyfriend is better in bed than richard ?
why ?
!
i mean if this guy was me and it was me who had learned that it was me who was the best you would ever had , I would be going like this .
yes !
well , you can not just not see rachel anymore , she is one of your best friends .
that is true !
that is true !
hey , there he is !
there he is !
how many times have i told you guys , you never watch the cooking channel !
hey !
oh that was yours ?
uh , yeah , we used it when the duck was throwing up caterpillars .
expect it in 4 6 weeks .
umm , hey , umm , joey's going to be at the telethon for the rest of the day , we have the whole place to ourselves .
well i just , thought maybe you would want to book some time with the best you would ever had .
why ?
what is your point ?
look , maybe i got carried away before .
but there is something you got to know .
if I am the best , it is only because you have made me the best .
i mean i was nothing before you .
call the other girls and ask .
which would not take long .
but when I am with you , and we are together , oh my god .
oh aw my god !
now , i understand if you never want to sleep with me again , but that would be wrong .
we are too good !
we owe it , to sex !
well , i was kind of hoping we could do this without him .

yeah , why do not we lose the gloves .
all right , let us show them how it is done .
y'know that was not part of it ?
nope .

'chand lrr ' .
i think i like it better that way .
oh , listen , the usher gave me this to give to you .
hey , kids .
well , i can not believe I have been here almost seven seconds and you have not asked me how my date went .
it was unbelievable .
i I have never met anyone like her .
she is had the most amazing life !
she was in the israeli army .
.
.
alright .
once i got on the subway , right , and it was at night , and i rode it all the way to brooklyn .
.
.
just for the hell of it .
we talked 'til like two .
it was this perfect evening .
.
.
more or less .
oh , I am sorry , so 'we ' is ?

oh , so you are divorced ?
oh , I am sorry , then you are widowed ?

.
sliding your foot so far up my pant leg you can count the change in my pocket ?
ethan ?

so explain something to me here , uh , what kind of a relationship do you imagine us having if you already have a husband and a boyfriend ?
.
hm .
what 'not work out ' ?
I am seeing her again on thursday .
did not you listen to the story ?
well , y'know , i had some trouble with it at first too , but the way i look at it is , i get all the good stuff : all the fun , all the talking , all the sex ; and none of the responsibility .
i mean , this is every guy's fantasy !
are we greeting each other this way now ?
because i like that .
thank god you did not try to fan out the magazines .
i mean , she will scratch your eyes right out .
someone is left a glass on the coffee table .
there is no coaster .
it is a cold drink , it is a hot day .
little beads of condensation are inching their way closer and closer to the surface of the wood .
.
.
oh no , it is terrific , it is .
.
.
it is .
.
.
y'know , you deserve this , after all your years of struggling , you have finally been able to crack your way into showbusiness .
where is joey ?
his mom's on the phone .
c'mon , we are roommates !
my eyes !
!
my eyes !
!
oh , that would be monica .
hey , listen , i want to borrow a coupla things , aurora spent the night , i really want to make her breakfast .
yeah , well , i only have twenty minutes until ethan , so , y'know .
.
no , no resentment , believe me , it is worth it .
'kay ?
y'know in a relationship you have these key moments that you know you will remember for the rest of your life ?
well , every   single   second is like that with aurora .
.
and I have just wasted about thirty five of them talking to you people , so , uh .
.
monica , can you help me with the door ?
god , i love these fingers .
.
.
no , actually i meant my fingers .
look at  them , look at how happy they are .
oh no nonononononnononono , do not go .
.
do not go .
too bad , she is leaving .
well , i thought   i thought you talked to rick .
what , ethan ?
he got to spend the whole day with you !
i know there will be many moments in the years to come when I will regret asking the following question , but   and andrew is ?
oh , so what you are saying is you are not completely fulfilled by rick , ethan and myself ?
well , y'know , most women would kill for three guys like us .
you .
nono , just you .
lose the other guys .
c'mon , we are great together , why not ?
.
well , y'know , part of me wants that , but it is like I am two guys , y'know ?
i mean , one guy's going 'shut up !
this is great ! '
but there is this other guy .
actually it is the same guy that wells up every time that grinch's heart grows three sizes and breaks that measuring device .
.
.
and he is saying , y'know , 'this is too hard !
get out !
get out ! '
i do not know , i i have to listen to both of them , they do not exactly let each other finish .
.
.
.
the second guy .
sorry , the first guy runs the lips .
big guy ?
something so sweet and .
disturbing about that .
guys , guys , I have got great news !
guess what  thank you .
i got a job in advertising .
actually , it pays nothing .
it is an internship .
right .
so , it will be the same except  less sex with you .
well , it is a training program , but at the end , they hire the people they like .
yeah , i mean , there is probably going to be some ground work which will probably stink , you know , grown man getting people coffee is a little humiliating  humiliating and noble !
good morning , everybody .
oh , no , no , I am an intern , just like you guys  except for the tie , the briefcase  and the fact that i can rent a car .
yeah , well , I am kind of heading into a new career direction and , you know , you got to start at the bottom .
right .
look , i know I am a little bit older than you guys , but it is not like I am bob hope  the comedian ?
uso ?
!
honey , I am old !
i am so much older than these other interns .
i can not compete with them .
yes , but i do not think life experience with these .
they are these prototype sneakers and come up with ideas on how to sell them which i can not do because no self respecting adult would ever where these .
what am i supposed to do with these ?
well , first of all , they are not called sneakers  anymore .
apparently , they are called kicks  or skids  and i think i heard somebody say slorps  .
and here , look : they have got these wheels to pop out from the bottom so you can roll around because , apparently , walking is too much exercise .
kids , kids , roll your way to childhood obesity !
would you help me try to sell these ?
no , i do not think that is the kind of thing they are looking for .
hey !
putting on the sneakers  thought I would get into a younger mindset , you know , to see if it sparked anything  yes , how is this : they are so uncomfortable it is like getting kicked in the nuts for your feet !
you know what  these are not half bad !
you should suggest something like these to ralph lauren .
alright  i feel youger already !
yah , i think i broke my hip .
okay   you start on the image of a guy putting on the shoes .
he is about my age  a huh .
so he is rolling down the street and he starts to lose control , you know  maybe he falls  maybe hurts himself .
just then , a kid comes flying by wearing the shoes .
he jumps over the old guy and laughs , and the line reads : not suitable for adults !
oh , thank you , sir  or man who is two years younger than me   i do not know , i don ' i don ' know !
i was just trying to get into a young mindset , you know , and it just started to flow .
the cold weather hurts my hip !
oh , great .
this is just .
.
.
oh my god , it is that victoria's secret model .
something .
.
.
something goodacre .
she is right , it is jill .
jill goodacre .
oh my god .
i am trapped in an atm vestibule with jill goodacre !
is it a vestibule ?
maybe it is an atrium .
oh , yeah , that is the part to focus on , you idiot !
jill says vestibule .
.
.
I am going with vestibule .
oh !
some guy .
some guy .
'hey jill , i saw you with some guy last night .
yes , he was some guy .
alright , alright , alright .
it is been fourteen and a half minutes and you still have not said one word .
oh god , do something .
just make contact , smile !
there you go !
you are definitely scaring here .
yeah , about 300 guys i went to high school with .
yeah , thanks .
hey , it is me .

put joey on the phone .
I am trppd .
.
.
in an atm vstbl .
.
.
wth jll gdcr .
yeah , like that thought never entered my mind .
um , is it sugarless ?
oh , then no thanks .
what the hell was that ?
mental note : if jill goodacre offers you gum , you take it .
if she offers you mangled animal carcass , you take it .
you know , on second thought , gum would be perfection .
'gum would be perfection ' ?
'gum would be perfection . '
could have said 'gum would be nice , ' or 'I will have a stick , ' but no , no , no , no .
for me , gum is perfection .
i loathe myself .
ah , let us see .
what next ?
blow a bubble .
a bubble's good .
it is got a .
.
.
boyish charm , it is impish .
here we go .
nice going , imp .
ok , it is ok .
all i need to do is reach over and put it in my mouth .
good save !
we are back on track , and I am .
.
.
chewing someone else's gum .

of course it is the shovel killer .
I would keep an eye on him !
we have to find out which one the father is .
i dunno , are not there tests for these things , right ?
pff , easy for you to say , he is a father killer .
he probably loves him mommy .
he is probably got a tattoo that says mom  on his shovel wielding arm !
hey !

oh god .

you know .
in fact i think we re two sachets away from becoming a lesbian couple .
nah , nah , it s okay .
i feel like i need to be in guy place .
you know , do kind of like a man thing .

hey ross , i was wondering if  oh my god !
!
where are all the men ?
?
?
monica , could you excuse us for a second ?
i need to talk to the girl with the flowers .
what is the matter with you  ?
!
?
you re arranging flowers !
you got dead flowers !
you got a picture , a picture , of a baby dressed like flowers !
this is not joey !
!
you re turning into a women .
now i ve upset you ?
what did i say ?
yeah , i think for us , kissing is pretty much like an opening act , y'know ?
i mean it is like the stand up comedian you have to sit through before pink floyd comes out .
the problem is , though , after the concert's over , no matter how great the show was , you girls are always looking for the comedian again , y'know ?
i mean , we are in the car , we are fighting traffic .
.
.
basically just trying to stay awake .
oh , i think this is the episode of three's company where there is some kind of misunderstanding .
oh , uh , that would be mine .
see , i wrote a note to myself , and then i realised i did not need it , so i balled it up and .
.
.
.
now i wish i was dead .
yes , and we all know how cruel a parent can be about the flatness of a child's pillow .
ew , ew , ew , ew ew ew ew ew !
ugly naked guy got a thighmaster !
you do not get a lot of 'doy ' these days .
.
.
.
dinah ?
now , monica , you know that is not how you look for an engagement ring in a lasagne .
.
.
boys ?
we are going in .
kind of puts that whole pillow thing in perspective , huh , mon ?
i mean presumably , the biggest part of your job is done .
what does she do ?
well , no , although i did have an imaginary friend , who .
.
.
my parents actually preferred .
i dunno , but .
.
i think it is about to attack the enterprise .
taste it .
yeah , i know , i did that two minutes ago .
hey , mister tux !
all right , i took the quiz , and it turns out , i do put career before men .
get up .
you are in my seat .
because i was sitting there .
well , it is not like i went to spain .
i went to the bathroom , you knew i was coming back .
the big deal is i was sitting there last , so , that is my seat .
all right , ross , i just have to do one thing , really quickly , it is not a big deal .
get up !
!
well , joey , i wrote a little song today .
it is called : get up .
really !
honey , you did call him back .
because , it is , it is really old .
you know what , okay , fine .
do not get up , you just sit right there .
i just hope , you do not mind , you know , my hand right here .
op , not touching , can not get mad !
not touching can not get mad !
not touching can not get mad !
maybe he is calling to say your obsessive and crazy .
all right , fine , you know what , we will both sit in the chair .
I am soooo , comfortable .
all right !
all right !
fine !
I am going .
but when i get back it is chair sitting , and I am the guy who is .
.
sitting in a chair !
maybe it was his sister's .
you know , maybe it was his daughter's .
all right , you will notice that i am fully dressed .
i , in turn , have noticed that you are not .
so in the words of a .
a .
milne , get out of my chair , dillhole !
what are you doing ?
the cushions are the essence of the chair !
oh ho , it will be back .
oh ho , there is nobody in the room .
we used them as pillows when we went camping .
the sheep .
he took my essence !
well , then it looks like somebody is going to have to give back somebody his cushions .
what are you , what are you going to show me my clothes ?
he is got nothing !
what are you supporting ?
monica , i think you have gone over to the bad place .
you know what is weird .
donald duck never wore pants .
but whenever he is getting out of the shower , he always put a towel around his waist .
i mean , what is that about ?
they got a phone in there , right ?
is it wrong that i was totally aroused by that ?
oh my god !
that is so not the opposite of taking somebody is underwear !

all right listen , i have to go to the bathroom , but if the place with the big fish comes up again .

yeah , we re going to have to get you out of those shoes .

i once had a thing of half and half , stole my car .

joey told you about the leg , huh ?
oh god , it freaked me out .
okay , i know it shouldn t have , but it did .
i mean i like her , i don t want to stop seeing her , but every so often it s like  hey , y'know what , where s your leg ?
i mean i m the smallest person in the world aren t i ?
i m the smallest person in the world .
actually he s the smallest person in the world .
it came up .
no .

no .
no .
i don t think so .
that s that s my nubbin .
it s kind of a ah , a third nipple kind of thing .

and ah one that barely qualifies as .
.
.
ahh , what ?
you ah , you have , you have to leave , now ?
how come ?
well hello !
the doctor .
oh yes !
just had me a little nubbin ectomy .
yep !
two nipples , no waiting .
that was an obvious joke , and i didn t think of it .
why didn t i think of it ?
the source of all my powers .
oh dear god , what have i done !
do you think that there s a town in missouri or some place called sample ?
and ah , as you re driving into town there s there s like a sign , and it says  you re in sample .
yeah , it s two guys in a ring , and the rules are :  they re are no rules .
yes , but there s two in martini , soo everybody back to my office .
oh it s bing , sir .
i m sorry  , i was just ah .
.
.
all right buddy , way to go !
thank you !
today , my boss keep slapping my butt and he was acting like it was no big deal .
well , i didn t do anything .
i didn t want to be the guy who has a problem with his boss slapping his bottom .
yeah , i know , for a really great stew you just y'know , stick your head in between  them .
what if joey were president ?
what is with him ?
well , that s not true , he he smacked you once .
no sir .
hey !
which one s my turkey burger ?
nine times !
okay , i had to put on lotion !
but , it s going to be okay , because as of tomorrow i m conducting an experiment , and if all goes as planned , my butt will be smack free .
excuse me , doug ?
hey there sports fan !
!
no , i ah , i didn t do them .
no , no i just ah , didn t do them .
instead , i ah , hung out with a couple of friends and had a couple of beers so i certainly don t deserve any praise , verbal or otherwise .
doug !
!
i m a little bit uncomfortable with the that way you express yourself .
no , no .
it it s not about the swearing , it s more about ah , the way , that you ah , occasionally , concentrate , your enthusiasm on my buttock .
oh , and don t get me wrong , i appreciate the sentiment .
it s just that i , i have a rather , sensitive posterior , and ah , besides , it s making all the other guys jealous .
okay .
ahhhhh !
thank you , sir .
no .
no , not at all , that s that s ridiculous .
ye ye yeah , yes i do !
run !
run you crazy , rich freak !
oh my god !
oh my god !
well , before we answer that , i think we should address the more important question .
how dumb are you ?
he s right .
nobody s going to benefit , and you re just going to hurt her .
all right look , if you absolutely have to tell her , at least wait until the timing s right .
and that s what deathbeds are for .
okay , okay okay , ah , chloe works with that guy issac .
issac s sister is jasmine .
and jasmine works at that message place with phoebe .
and phoebe s friends with rachel .
and that s the trail , i did it !
off ?
!
!
yeah , well i don t think you can make that statement , unless you ve been kicked in an area that god only meant to be treated nicely .
oh , that s mature .
nothing , nothing .
yeah , well , i guess they had a fight , and he got drunk .
.
.
.
he has sex , and we get hit in our heads .
uh oh .
she was not good .
not good .
uh oh .
yeah , never cheat on rachel .
y'know what , i think we can go out there .
i mean they have more important things to worry about .
wax the door shut , we re never leaving , ever .
oh great , food with hair on it .
because that would be crazy ?
yeah , come on , it s ross and rachel , they ve got too .
what ?
are you actually saying these words ?
let s go .
is that your new walk ?
wait a minute , wait .
you re telling me this actress person is the only woman you ever wanted who didn t want you back ?

my grandmother used to say that exact same thing to me .
hey .
oh , that s that s okay , no problem .
yes , i realise that .
that s the stuff !
thanks , it s ah , gaelic , for  thy turkey s done .
so ah , i m going to go , nice , nice meeting you .

yeah , she seemed cool , attractive .
i ll do it .
hey , my father s house does that !
well , the movie was great , dinner was great , and there s nothing like a cool , crisp new york evening .
of course , i didn t get to enjoy any of that , because joanna s such a big , dull dud !
i m telling ya , joanna s got it all wrong .
okay ?
all i said was ,  this was fun .
let s do it again sometime .
i ll give you a call .
that s what you say at the end of a date .
to her face ?
look it s the end of the date , i m standing there , i know all she s waiting for is for me to say  i ll call her  and it s just y'know , comes out .
i can t help it , it s a compulsion .
multiple , so many paper cuts .
oh , well give me the phone then .
look , you can t call somebody after this long just to say ,  in case you didn t notice , i don t like you !
nooo !
!
she s really dull !
and she gets this gross mascara goop thing in the corner of her eye !
all right !
fine !
but it s just a lunch date , no more than an hour !
and from now on i get my own dates , i don t want you setting me up with anybody ever again !
that s just a lot of big talk , y'know .
it s not a big deal .
it s , just it s right here ,  and it s all the time .
yes , this , this was pleasant .
the food there was , was great .
so take care .
well , this was great .
i ll give you a call .
we should do it again sometime .
noo !
look , i m sorry .
okay ?
i m weak , and pathetic , and sorry .
ahhhh i m not going to call you .
i m sorry .
i m i m i m sorry that i said i was going to when i m not .
look , this has nothing to do with you , y'know ?
and this isn t rachel s fault .

if you just got a chance  we really didn t get a chance to  ross !
it s got your wavy black lines !
y know who has a great video camera ?
let s call  them .
here you go .

i don t know !
you were a delight to talk to .
you asked all those insightful , great questions .
yeah , we re going to need to see that tape .
i still don t get it , we didn t do anything wrong .
i thought you said those jokes were funny .
joke !
joke !
joke !
well maybe it was all of your questions .
the sheer volume , it was like flying with the riddler !
was that another question ?
did you do it on our invitations ?
!
so , just the ones gave back to us and we had framed !
that s the magic story you use when you want to have sex !
jenny !
that is so jenny !
hey pheebs , what s up ?
buy stamps , pick up dry cleaning don t let phoebe in .
well , phoebe i thought i d yeah , what the hell .
hey babe .
who says you can t get a nice punch bowl for under six bucks ?
maybe we can take it back ?
how about to the street say from the balcony ?
okay .
how about in that cabinet ?
how about the closet by the bathroom ?
oh no no no , i will do it .
honey , you have to learn to sit down and relax and let your husband take care of things once and awhile .
it s locked , you have to help me .
why is it locked ?
oh y know , i ve been living here a while and i ve never seen what s inside that closet .
what is , what is in there ?
don t try to make me uncomfortable with feminine stuff !
fine .
love you .
phoebe if it helps alexandra has only been massaging monica for like three years .
if !
i said , if it helps !
i wasn t trying to open your closet !
i wasn t trying to open your closet !
i swear !
monica has a secret closet and she won t let me see what s in it .
i don t know !
what could she possibly be hiding in here that i can t see ?
!
why would monica be keeping richard in here ?
and here we go  there has got to be a way !
yeah .
oh no wait , i m not an nine year old girl .
maybe monica has a bobby pin .
so , how s the hideously inappropriate crush on rachel coming ?
that s a good idea .
okay .
so uh , ross is kind of bummed huh ?
well , it s not your fault .
what are you going to do ?
not take her to the hospital ?
y know ?
you re doing nothing wrong .
except for harboring an all consuming love for the woman whose carrying his baby .
richard ?
if if you re in there , could you pass me my credit card ?
not to shabby , i got this all off myself using my wife s tools .
oh my god !
you re messy .
i married fred sanford !
no , honey you re not sick !
look , i don t love you because you re organized , i love you in spite of that .
yes !
and look , now that i know if i got some extra stuff lying around can we , can we share the closet .
hey .
so rachel s all moved out huh ?
how are you taking it ?
are you okay ?
no no no no , we are done .
and , we are done with the yogurt .
ah , it is just a weekend , big deal !
ok , you are going to have to stop that , forever !
you think ?
ok , so it is just because it was my table , i have to buy a new one ?
what rule ?
there is no rule , if anything , you owe me a table !
well , i believe the piece of furniture was fine until your little breakfast adventure with angela delvecchio well , let us just say the impressions you made in the butter left little to the imagination .
what do you mean , like , buy it together ?
you think we are ready for something like that ?
well , it is a pretty big commitment , i mean , what if one of us wants to move out ?
I am not moving out .
yeah , yeah , it is just that with my last roommate kip .
.
.
it is just that we bought a hibachi together , and then he ran off and got married , and things got pretty ugly .
aw , do not do that fine .
more coffee over here , please !
so what are you going to do ?
oh , yeah , you have to tell her .
that is patio furniture !
what about the birds ?
you pick one .
oh , so , forget about the birds , but big red insects suggest fine dining !
not like that , i will not !
kip would have liked the birds !
so , what do you think ?
i know !
what are you still doing here ?
she just broke up with the guy , it is time for you to swoop in !
my catholic friend is right .
she is distraught .
you are there for her .
you pick up the pieces , and then you usher in the age of ross !
wha   hey !
yeah , get out !
one more game ?
what s the matter honey ?
already ?
!
oh , i got some thoughts on that .
what in god s name is that ?
!
well , you couldn t get them anyway .
ian doesn t plan anymore and derrick   and derrick is a name i shouldn t know .
why are you napping over here instead of over at your place ?
now , do i get to look at this book or is it just for people who are actually involved in the wedding ?
okay .
centerpieces !
definitely roses .
well , i just think they re a little more weddingy .
but lilies are the clear choice .
uh huh !
oh yeah , i should probably call them .
oh , i don t think i ever heard that story .
what a sweet story .
clearly i did not start drinking enough at the start of the meal .
i don t know , my mother spent most of her money on her fourth wedding .
she s saving the rest for her divorce .
and any extra cash my father has he saves for his yearly trips to  dollywood .
honey , it s going to be okay .
look , it really is going to be okay .
the important thing is that we love each other and that we re going to get married .
well , i have some .
well , close to   well , you re not suggesting that we spend all of the money on the wedding ?
well , come on , i ve been saving this money for six years and i kind of had some of it earmarked for the future , not just for a party .
no , i realize that honey , but i m not going to spend all of the money on one party .
look , i understand , but i have to put my foot down .
okay ?
the answer is no .
yes , i am !
hey .
ehh .
look , i thought about it too , and i m sorry .
i think we should spend all of the money on the wedding .
yeah , i m putting my foot down .
yeah look , when i proposed i told you that i would do anything to make you happy , and if having the perfect wedding makes you happy then , then that s what we re going to do .
eh , forget about the future and stuff !
so we only have two kids , y know ?
we ll pick our favorite and that one will get to go to college .
yeah .
uh , four , a boy , twin girls and another boy .
well , stuff like where d we live , y know ?
like a small place outside the city , where our kids could learn to ride their bikes and stuff .
y know , we could have a cat that had a bell on it s collar and we could hear it every time it ran through the little kitty door .
of course , we d have an apartment over the garage where joey could grow old .
sure you do .
you sure ?
i love you so much .
oh yeah , totally !
or .
.
.
dick .
was it like a sneeze only better ?
no !
!

.
.
fancier than a pimple .

hey !
well , y'know if joey and i played with matches we could get you up to an even hundred .
you are right , i know .
okay , how did it go at the doctor's ?
y'know what ?
you should go to my guy , because when i went in there with my third nipple .
he just lopped it right off .
y'know ?
so i guess I am lucky .
i mean not as lucky as people who were born with two nipples .
well , if he is going to break up with you , maybe joey and i should water his plants .
if y'know what i mean .
well sensitive is important , pick him .
i kea !
this is comfortable .
so , what do you thing the good news is ?
yes , but this is pete .
okay ?
he s not like other people , on your first date he took you to rome .
for most guys that s like a third or fourth date kind of thing .
oh , so you re going with the teacher , huh ?
everything s going to be all right .
okay , dick ?
six hour trip to london .
that s a lot of monica .

to put the camera away !
!
!
well , i don t have to buy that , i m with stupid  t shirt anymore .
all right , look , you re not really going to buy that are you ?
don t you think you ve embarrassed me enough for one day ?
how can i answer that when i m pretending i don t know you ?
oh really ?

i am not going to be embarrassed anymore !
hey .

alright , so I am back in high school , I am standing in the middle of the cafeteria , and i realize i am totally naked .
then i look down , and i realize there is a phone .
.
.
there .
that is right .
all of a sudden , the phone starts to ring .
now i do not know what to do , everybody starts looking at me .
finally , i figure I would better answer it , and it turns out it is my mother , which is very very weird , because   she never calls me !
cookie ?
sometimes i wish i was a lesbian .
.
.

and i just want a million dollars !

i would have to say that is an 'l ' shaped bracket .
i have no idea .
all finished !
yes , please do not spoil all this fun .
oh , god .
oh my god !
you must stop !
look , ross , you got to understand , between us we have not had a relationship that has lasted longer than a mento .
you , however have had the love of a woman for four years .
four years of closeness and sharing at the end of which she ripped your heart out , and that is why we do not do it !
i do not think that was my point !
stay out of my freezer !
[scene : a restaurant , monica and paul are still eating . ]
angela's the screamer , andrea has cats .
that is amazing .
if can invade poland , there is not anything i can not do .
hi , paul , is it ?
all right , kids , i got to get to work .
if i do not input those numbers , .
.
.
it does not make much of a difference .
.
.
'look , gippetto , I am a real live boy . '
you are right , I am sorry .
once i was a wooden boy , a little wooden boy .
.
.
and yet you are surprisingly upbeat .
oh , how well you know me .
.
.
y'know , if you listen closely , you can hear a thousand retailers scream .

kids , new dream .
.

.
.
I am liza minelli   what did i marry into ?
you guys just keep getting cooler and cooler !
I am leaving you .

i had sex in high school .
.
.
all right , I would say we make a pact .
neither of us will go out with missy goldberg .
all right , so that is missy goldberg , phoebe cates and molly ringwald , who neither of us can go out with .
oh , and sheena easton .
but we probably could not get her anyway .
well , i officially give you permission to break the pact .
your hands are shaking .
excuse me .
.
that did not make us sound gay at all !
ross , that was 16 years ago !
i believe the foundation of our friendship was unfortunate hair .
all right , look , if we are really going to do this .
.
.
it is not like you never broke one of the pacts .
oh really ?
oh really !

adrienne turner !

look  it was a lo of ong time ago .
hmm mmmhm .

well maybe if you go to school here next year we can totally hang out .
well , maybe you can get in on a beauty scholarship .

why ?
you kissed her that night too ?
seriously , where did this happen ?
oh wait .
.
.

I am pretty sure i put her on my bed .
why would i kiss a girl , and then put her on your bed ?
what did i marry into ?

well , i have a girlfriend , i m i m happy .
so , i no longer feel the need to go out of my way to stop others from being happy .
oh and ross was like what ?
a lion tamer ?
hey , you know what you can do ?
i remember reading about this director , i think it was orson wells , who at the beginning of the movie would hire somebody , just so he could fire them in front of everybody .
then they would all know , who s boss .
yes .

og ee op , i m not asking for me , i m  i mean  no , i m i m not gay , i m not asking you out .

!
and he was going to propose ?
and you did it first ?
!
this is going to kill him !
you know how much he loves to propose !
well , what did she say ?
does ross know ?
well maybe you don t have to tell him anything .
if you clear things up with rachel then ross never needs to find out , but you have to do it now before he hears about it and kicks your ass !
honey , we ve been over this .
i need to be facing the other way .
i m so tired .
yeah okay , but no foreplay .
hello sir , you know monica .
look , we can t stay in here forever .
this is okay .
we re all adults here ; there s nothing to be ashamed of .
now , let s put our underwear in our pockets and walk out the door .
i just want you to know that what you witnessed in there , that wasn t for fun .
why ?
why why would you wh why   look , i just don t want you to think that we re animals who do it whenever we want .
that s funny , this conversation s how i got the bullet hole in my head .
seriously sir , my brains ?
all over the wall .
you still haven t told rachel you weren t really proposing ?
joey , you have to tell her what s going on !
and what did it look like ?
!
go and tell rachel right now before ross finds out .
okay , look , just do it gently .
hey .
that is right .
oh no .
okay .
hey !
you okay ?
did he just say , he loves fonzie ?
all right  yeah , that is when if you get the babies out by the end of the month , they give you 2 % financing .
really ?
male nurses ?
so they are going on dates ?
when ?
this this fonzie person you keep referring too , is that uh , is that another doctor ?
all right .
oh hey hey hey !

so , are you really going to go out with that nurse man ?
y'know , i do not know if you have ever looked up the term goofing around in the dictionary  well , i have , and the technical definition is , two friends who care a lot about each other and have amazing sex and just want to spend more time together .
but if you have this new fangled dictionary that gets you made at me , then we have to , y'know , get you my original dictionary .
i am so bad at this .
really ?
okay , so  y'know , i sensed that i should stop .
so we are okay ?
right !
so uh , now that little chandler turned out to be a girl , what are they going to name her ?
that is kind of a masculine name , do not you think ?
buh bye .

betrothed couple .
hey !
pheebs ?

when we get married , are you going to change your last name to bing ?
why not ?
hey !

well , she is just so much fun with joey , i just assumed , she would still be living with him .
no reason , except she told me .
no !
no , she did not say that .
i i i think you should talk to monica now .
bing does not seem so weird now , does it ?
hi , could we get two burritos to go , please ?
forty five minutes ?
we have tickets to the musicman at 8:00 .
is this because of the burrito thing ?
give him money ?
it was a joke !
right , calm down , of'mally .
I will slip him some money .
hey , i can be smooth .
listen , we are a little bit in a hurry , so , if you can get us a table a little quicker , I would appreciate it .
okay .
had the money in the wrong hand .
how do you know so much about this ?
richard used to do it , did not he ?
mustached bastard   excuse me .
.
.
ahh hahaha !
thank you gunther , put it there .
definitely not easier with coins .
thank you .
hey pheebs !
if you want to give joey a christmas present that disrupts the entire building , why not get him something a little bit more subtle , like a wrecking ball , or a vile of small pox to release in the hallway ?
ho , ho , ho !
merry christmas !
hey !
well , I am here to see my old buddy ben .
what are you doing here , weird turtle man ?
what ?
you bet i did , ben , put it there !
well , it would have worked this time , if his hands were not so damn small !
ho , ho , ho !
you called everyone and said you were having trouble finding a santa costume , so i borrowed one from a guy at work !
why ?
but i did not get to shape my belly like a bowl full of jelly .
fine , I will give the suit back .
santa ?
really ?
did your dad ever dress up like santa ?
then it is okay !
because , if santa and the holiday armadillo ?
.
are ever in the same room for too long the universe will implode .
merry christmas !
well , I will stay , but only because i want to hear about hanukkah .
ben , will you sit here with santa and learn about hanukkah ?
my favorite part was when superman flew all the jews out of egypt .
honey , you remember my boss doug right ?

y know what would really help me through this tough time is choking something .
can i choke ya ?
oh no no no , monica would freak .
but to hell with that bitch .
oh that s all right sir , and that s just one girl .
it s a hand .
it s a thing you use as a jack and coke holder .
oh no no no !
hi honey i m home .
it was awful .
to get out of going to dinner with doug i told him that you and i split up .
so then he took me to all these strip clubs and sleazy bars , and then when i wouldn t give him my wedding ring , he threw a soda can at a bird !
y know what the worse part was ?
i got to see what my life would be like without you .
it was like it s a wonderful life with lap dances .
please promise that you will never leave me , that we will grow old together , and be with each other for the rest of our lives .
ooh , i don t know if we re there yet .

y'know , we do not have to watch this .
weekend at bernie's is on showtime , hbo , and cinemax .
exactly .
weekend at bernie's !
dead guy getting hit in the groin twenty , thirty times !
no ?
yeah , well , you would not think it was cool if you are eleven years old and all your friends are passing around page 79 of 'mistress bitch . '
you can say that because she is not your mom .
shhh , busy beaming with pride .
now why would she say that is embarrassing ?
that is too much information !

you got to let me slam the door !
what was that ?
yeah , i believe i was talking to joey , alright there , mother kisser ?
yes , well , i expect this from her .
okay ?
she is always been a freudian nightmare .
because it is complicated , it is complex   hey , you kissed my mom !

i am , i actually am .
i mean this is amazing .
my entire life i have feared this place , and now that I am here it is like what was the big deal .

and I would be okay .

I have scared ya ' !
I have said too much !
I am hopeless , and awkward , and desperate for love !

someone comment on the pants !
that is not what i had in mind !

what ?
hey , so where are we staying ?
is the movie putting us up in a big hotel suite ?
i see , but once you get your first paycheck you will be springing a big hotel suite , right ?
i mean , lead in a movie , they must be paying you a lot ?
so you do not get paid unless the movie makes money ?
all right , bye bye now !
okay !
we have been driving for a half hour , and you have not looked at the road once .
yeah .
is not that ross's money ?
i do not know .
okay !
too dry .
no !
no !
yes .
i also said , yes !
no !
ahhh !
!
!
look joe , i just , i just do not want to get your hopes up real high .
they are not even paying ya !
this does not even sound like a real movie !
joe , i do not think this is going to be your big break .
oh , you do not want me on the trip ?
all right , I will tell ya what , the next time you ask me a question like that I will lie .
all right , fine !
fine !
why do not you pull over ?
I will get out right now !
you are not actually supposed to stop on the bridge .
all right !
!
wait !
wait , there is no sidewalk !
yeah , I am going to die here .
hey !
joey kicked me out of the car on the george washington bridge !
i do not know !
he went crazy !
y'know , we were playing that game where you you ask a question and you answer it really fast .
well , i do not know what mad him so mad , y'know ?
all i said was that uh , i did not think this was not going to be his big break , that this movie was not going to do anything for him , and that uh , y'know it did not sound like a real movie   okay , he should have pushed me off of the bridge .
oh , i figured you guys would all be mad at me .
so i got you some gifts that i found on the side of the road .
who wants the teddy bear with one leg ?
is that joey ?
is that joey ?
let me talk to him !
i want to talk to him !
y'know , he will not even talk to me .
how am i going to apologize to him if he will not even talk to me ?
that is a good idea .
i wonder where i could  get a basket of porn  really ?
oh no no no , i m , i m paddling away !
wow !

we get all this rusty crap for free ?
!
could we be more white trash ?

i ah , bumped into joanna on the street yesterday .
well , no , actually she uh , asked me if i wanted to get a drink .
no .
no !
well , not at first .
well , i think i judged her too quickly , and this time we were able to take the relationship to the next level .
oh , come on !
it s not like this is an everyday occurrence for me !
i mean usually i m pretty much just in there by myself .
okay , i promise , i ll end it .
i hope you know what i m giving up for ya , because she s not just the boss in your office , if you know what i mean .
it was like the algonquin kids table .
it just doesn t feel like we re breaking up .
okay .
thanks .
okay .
i m getting dressed .
when i walk outside naked people throw garbage at me .
what is it ?
ah ha , you re not the boss of me .
yeah , you are !

you get back here right now !
why not ?
!
what ?

rachel , could i see you for a moment ?
okay , here s the situation .
the keys to the cuffs are on the back of the door .
could you be a doll and grab them and scoot on over and unlock me ?
and on a totally different subject , that is a lovely pantsuit .
i did break up with her !
she just took it really , really well !
it did enter my mind !
but then something happened that made it , shoot right out .
no no no no no no no !
!
i can t get myself right out of them !
you must have me confused with the amazing chandler !
!
come on , you have to unlock me , she could be gone for hours , and i m cold , and  never !
fine !
i never borrowed your walkman .
you got it !
here we go !
come on !
this is great !
ahhh !

hello sweet pants !
about what ?
i ll make something up !
i m good at lying , i actually did borrow your walkman !
oh ho ho , i don t think so !
well , this is much better .
hey , look , you re in trouble either way !
okay ?
if she comes back and sees me locked to this instead of the chair , she s going to know you were in here .

it still wouldn t be clean .
all i want is my freedom .
freedom !

it s 6:00 .
hey , i hear that you and joshua are going out to dinner with ross and emily , and i think that s , i think that s really cool .
what ?
yeah , well , i don t dance at weddings .
because weddings are a great place to meet women , and when i dance , i look like this   hey !

yes he did .
hey , check out that girl !
she is really hot !
you re coming on to the entire room !
i m chandler .
hi .
you mind if i  so uh , what are you in for ?
what a coincidence , i listen in my sleep .
hello !
little ones .
yep !
and !
a beautiful woman agreed to go out with me .
joey wanted to ask her out , but uh , she picked me .
because i m cooler .
well she s , she s the kind of girl joey was unconscious .
plus , you look cool .
what ?
okay , let me just jump in and ask , at what point did you think this was a successful marriage ?
ross , just for my own piece of mind , you re not married to anymore of us are ya ?
you left a shoe here ?
!
oh good , when he comes back for his keys , i ll be sure to give him your shoe .
yeah , all right .
whoa whoa whoa !
what ?
yeah , i m going to pass .
because i was kind of iffy when it was puppies .
little baby girl chandler , where i have heard that before ?
oh right , coach ruben .
do you know what pheebs ?
when you re done over there , we kind of have a situation over here too .
see that s where i think that you re wrong .
we ve been playing these babies man for man ; we should really be playing a zone defense .
i just think that things would go a lot smoother if we each have our own zone .
phoebe , you can be in charge of wiping .
and y know mon , you can be in charge of diapering and i can be in charge of looking how cute they are when they put their hands around   okay , i m a rookie .
i should not be in the end zone .
hey !
shocking !
since you still have the keys .
what equity investments ?
you don t even have a car !
and ?
there you are .
check it out !
check it out !
when the babies wake up , they can meet krog !
he can do more than that !
he can destroy the universe !
they re not going to swallow anything , you guys are being way over protective .
when i was a kid , my mom used to just throw me into a pile of broken glass !
glass , sand , whatever .
all right .
i thought about it and maybe you re right .
maybe krog is not a safe toy .
i swallowed the sonic blaster gun .
well , i was trying to prove that i was right .
y know ?
and it turns out i was wrong .
and now it s lodged in my throat .
but you found the keys to his clothes ?
that is true .
ahh , i think it just moved .
it s really poking me .
i think that s gum .
okay , listen this really hurts .
let s go .
hey !
well , let s just say that krog will be fully equipped to destroy the universe again in twelve to fourteen hours .
and protected them from a tornado ?
was the setting of phoebe s triumph .
is not as important as the fact that phoebe took care of the babies all by herself .
phoebe , would you take a look at this mess !
!
!
!
ross and the most beautiful girl in the world .
where did you , when did you , how did you .
.
.
how did you get a girl like that ?
okay , but that is , like , the easiest era .
hi .
you guys have any wrapping paper ?
phebes , it was your birthday , like , months ago .
well , i have a call in about that .
actually , this is for kathy's birthday .
it is an early edition of her favorite book .
okay , but do not touch it , because you fingers have destructive oils .
oh , it was not a big deal .
i just went to a couple of bookstores , talked to a couple of dealers .
.
.
called a couple of the author's grandchildren .
it does not say that .
does it ?
okay , all right , I will just uh , make sure that uh , joey gets her something really great .
it is okay , the duck's using our bathroom anyway .
hey joe !
what are you getting kathy for her birthday ?
sure .
.
.
i do not know .
.
.
um , grease ?
rent ?
okay , so when do you want to go ?
yes , it is , at office max .
a pen .
huh huh !
you can not give her that .
because she is not eleven !
and it is not the seventh night of hanukkah !
all right , look , look .
what did .
.
.
what did you get for angela delveccio for her birthday ?
for three years ?
all right .
i will go out and i will try to find something for her , okay ?
would you like me to write her a little poem as well ?
okay , all right .
i just spent the entire afternoon looking for a present for kathy that would be better than the rabbit .
oh , yeah .
yeah , i found this great place called invisible things for kathy .
can you give me a hand with all this stuff ?
she is really going to love this , you know ?
the bottom line is i want her to have it , even if i do not get to be the one who gives it to her .
yeah ?
you do not think it is just pathetic ?
where ?
i got something for her .
it is a book !
no , it is a book that is just a book , okay ?
it is an early edition of the velveteen rabbit .
it was her favorite book as a kid .
so , uh , just .
.
.
let me know if she likes it , okay ?
no , it came out to an even twenty .
hey , how did it go ?
how did she like the gift ?
oh yeah ?
that is great !
[nodding , with mixed feelings ] aahhuuhhh .
.
.
.
hey !
happy birthday .
no he did not .
[moving it back . ]
happy birthday !
I am sorry .
see , you think it is just a pen , but then you turn it over and it is also a clock .
oh , yeah .
.
.
yeah .
[to kathy ] goodnight .
oh , uh , yeah .
.
.
i just knew that sometimes when you are writing , you .
.
.
you do not always know the exact time .
uh , the book ?
what do you mean ?
uhl  ell .
by the way , in case you missed that , that sound was , uhl , ell .
oh , yeah , he is my .
.
.
he is my best friend .
goodnight .
I am sorry !
rachel , wait , wait .
can i just say one thing ?
that is a relatively open weave and i can still see your .
.
.
nipular areas .
oh , yes , could i have one of those .
okay .
no , she is still upset because i saw her boobies .
it was an accident .
not like i was across the street with a telescope and a box of donuts .
y'know , i do not know why you are so embarrassed , they were very nice boobies .
okaaay ,  rock , hard place , me .
whoah whoah , back up there , sparky .
what did you mean by that ?
huh .
uhhuh , how did you know that ?
what ?
what ?
y'know , i do not see that happening ?
well I am not showing you my 'tat . '
oh , good .
rog is here .
oh , it is nothing , it is a little thing .
.
.
i hate that guy .
oh look , it is the woman we ordered .
uh , joey's having an embolism , but I would go for a nip , y'know ?
joey , if i go first , i want to be looking for my keys .
so , who is up for a big game of kerplunk ?
c'mon , I will show you to my room .
.
that sounds so weird when it is not followed by no thanks , it is late .
hey , kicky .
what are you doing ?
well , you are going to .
are they end to end , or tall like pancakes ?
hey , you are not him .
you are you .
when they were all over you to go into your father's pipe fitting business , did you cave ?
no .
you decided to go into the out of work actor business .
now that was not easy , but you did it !
and I would like to believe that when the right woman comes along , you will have the courage and the guts to say no thanks , I am married .
yeah .
i really do .
get off !
what ?
what ?
sorry , my my thing was in there with me .
basically we just feel that he is .
.
.
things sure have changed here on waltons mountain .
if i turn into my parents , I will either be an alcoholic blond chasing after twenty year old boys , or .
.
.
I will end up like my mom .
let me ask you , why is everybody using these tiny lights nowadays ?
i remember when people used to use big lights .
i dunno what it is , it just doesn t quite feel like christmas to me .
see now it feels like christmas !
hey joe what s up ?
i can see why that s hard to resist .
you are aware that she s not a monkey , right ?
ah , you re still just a little fat girl inside aren t you ?
what , what are you laughing at ?
i don t think so .
oh my god !
i can save you time ladies , i m right here .

oh well , that makes it not terrible .
no not okay , you can t look for monica s presents !
no , you don t have to , and you can t because i live here too .
why ?
no , i have a great idea for a present for her .
if i help , we can find  them faster !

now just give her a chance , okay ?
what s the matter ?
see ?
i told you .
what ?
so she stole your pants and then she came back and wore them in front of you ?
she must ve been planning this for years !
honey , isn t it possible that the company that sold the jeans made more than just the one pair ?
so , shouldn t we go give her the benefit of the doubt before we go snooping around her crotch ?
out of curiosity , what is your secret ingredient ?
hi !
how come ?
to see her pants ?
are you sure ?
did you see the stain ?
god !
she is not stealing from us !
okay , will you let this go ?
oh dear god !
and yet you don t recognize that you re crazy .
here s another plan no !
why ?
i fear a jury will see it the same way !
you see that ?
all right .
yes .
okay .
i get your point .
but if it s not your bra will you just let the woman clean the apartment ?

i would much rather be mr.peanut than mr.salty .
i feel violated .
and not in a good way .
i am telling you , years from now , schoolchildren will study it as one of the greatest first dates of all time .
it was unbelievable !
we could totally be ourselves , we did not have to play any games .

how needy do i want to seem ?
I am right , right ?

what are you looking at me for ?
i did not know that .
can i use your phone ?
yes , it is working !
why is not she calling me back ?
y'do not think that makes me seem a little .
.
.
ah , you obviously saw my personal ad .
she answered .
I am not going to talk to her , she obviously got my message and is choosing not to call me .
now I am needy and snubbed .
god , i miss just being needy .
if it helps , i could slide over .
hello ?

so how is mindy ?
hell is filled with people like you .
.
and boogie !
okay , I am going to go to the bathroom .

i have some pride .
no !
danielle , hi !

I am fine .
uh , listen , i do not know if you tried to call me , because , uh , idiot that i am , i accidentally shut off my phone .
oh , uh , okay , that is fine , that is great .

i mean , .
.
.
how needy is that ?
yeah .
we do not feel like we can host thanksgiving this year .
well , it is just with uhm , work and the stress of adoption , we just do not feel like we have the energy .
plus , we do not think it is fair that every year the burden falls on us .
no , no !
we made this decision together .
do not let yourself get manipulated this way !
we are supposed to make these decisions together !
did you not watch the doctor phil i taped for you ?
why come all the way from kansas to do that ?
you know what just occurred to me ?
this could be our last thanksgiving just the two of us .
i mean , we could be getting a baby soon !
somebody is going to pick us .
I am telling ya !
it is going to happen .
next year it is going to be you , me and the little hemingway bing .
what , he is my favourite author !
the firm  ?
you know , you always cook this meal all by yourself .
let me help this year .
I am serious , let me do something , just not the turkey or the stuffing , nothing high profile  .
tell me more .
you obviously have not tasted my palmolive potatoes !
oh my god !
hmm , the game's at one .
dinner is at four , we will never going to make it back .
you say that now , but it could take us a long time to get back home .
plus joey could get lost and and they could have to page us to go pick him up .
look , monica has been working hard all day , she did not want to host this thing in the first place , we should not go !
okay .
and get ready to taste my very special cranberries .
or should i say .
.
.
chanberries !
i can not believe they are not here !
i slave and i slave for what ?
they have ruined cranberry day !
they are out there !
everything is so distorted !
looks like joey has a giant hand !
which says rangers  on it .
they went to the game !
ross ' shirt is torn .
yeah , and there is a bowl of cranberry sauce that .
.
.
what happens to cranberry sauce ?
oh thank god !
that is a lie , you went to the game , i can see joey's hand .
guys , I would listen to her .
the vein is bigger than I have ever seen it .
ha ha !
all you got was monica's stinky brussels sprouts !
please let me stay on this side of the door .
the cranberries .
.
.
?
he is doing that weird eye contact thing .
do not look at him , do not look at him !
the floating heads do make a good point .
well , you manheads are not any better .
you lied about going to the game .
you knew it would make you late , and you still went anyway .
that would be a lot more convincing if you were not drooling .
a little late for that .
uhm , we have got turkey grease .
can you ever feel your ears ?
oh , i left them on my bulldozer .
.
.
i do not have tools !
okay , look , I am going to pull on the door and you guys push as hard as you can .
maybe we can get enough room to wiggle him out , okay ?
okay , so push !
come on guys , push !
my cranberries !
argh !
i can not believe what you did .
monica's going to kill you !
look !
look !
look what the .
.

who s number two ?
one of the more difficult games sewer workers play .
bye !
yeah , and i don t have any cologne .
oh !
worm medicine for the duck .
hey !
can you take a duck and a chick to the theatre ?
okay .
i just wanted them to hear it from somebody else .
there he is !
almost as good as that play with the two naked girls on the see saw .
i know .
so that s the girl you like .
wait a minute , wait a minute , you don t like the guy rachel s dating ?
well , that s odd .
could i borrow it ?
oh ho ho ho .
7:15 .
watch doesn t work .
yeah , and at the end of the play , he , he got up y'know , and he just started like ,  banging his hands together !
ross , don t .
ross !
ohh , that s a good one .
why don t you use ours across the hall ,  because she has problems .
step away from the duck .
and yet , she s still not hanging up the phone .
hey man , what is up ?
yeah , yeah !
me too !
yeah .
well , i like danger .
tonight ?
you you did not say it was going to be at nighttime .

that sandwich really does smell good .
i can not smell your sandwich ?
okay , I will give them back .
look !
what is so great about that sandwich ?
okay .
yeah .
sur surprise him ?
we are not , we are not going to make anybody mad are we ?
how do you figure that ?

it , it sounds gay .
look at officer ross riding back here with the visitors .
okay , y'know , we we are safe right ?
i mean nothing bad can go down !
oh , hurry up .
i want to sign that .
what is going on ?
uh , hello !
!
it was a car backfire !
who jumps at loud noises !
yeah !
if the car that backfired had run over you !
y'know what , i think I will go home before ross starts rambling about his newfound respect for life .
oh my god !
oh , i just went for a walk , around the living room .
whatever  no .
no I am just tired .
y'know , from from the walk .
you dove in front of ross !
ross !
i do not hate ross !
what picture ?
look I am very glad that you saved ross from the car backfire , but y'know , it could have been a bullet and you y'know , you did not try to save me !
when it comes down to it , you would risk your life for ross before you would for me .
that is the bottom line .
from a bullet !
much sense ?
!
so you risked your life , for a sandwich !
so you did not uh , choose ross before me .
really ?
!
thanks .
oh oi ho , yeah !
hm hmm .
i thought you were showing me how much you mean to me .
before or after you were shot by your own troops ?
yes , if the foxhole was lined with sandwiches .

look forget it okay ?
i don t want to go .
i don t want to see him .
i don t want to .
no no all kids are embarrassed by their parents , you d have to come up with a whole new word for what i went through .
when i was in high school , he used to come to all of my swim meets dressed as a different hollywood starlet .
y know it s hard enough to be fourteen .
you re skinny .
you re wearing speedoes that your mom promised that you would grow into !
and you look up into the stands and there s your dad cheering you on dressed as carmen miranda .
we was wearing a headdress with real fruit that he will later hand out to your friends as a healthy snack !
he had sex with mr .
girabaldi !
does it matter ?
!
yeah of okay , but i m just doing this for you .
so i really never get to win anymore ?
yeah , i just ordered a beer !
no !
no !
i don t want him to know we re yet !
i m not sure i m ready for that .
and besides he s not going to be too happy to see me either .
i don t know if i ve told you this , but he s kind of tried to get in contact with me a lot over the last few years yeah , he s made phone calls , written letters , he even came to new york , but i always said i was too busy to see him .
y know it s all very cats in the cradle i don t want to get into it .
here we go .
and there s daddy !
believe me , i ve been saying that for years .
oh my god !
that s mr .
girabaldi playing the piano .
he s coming into the audience .
he s coming into the audience .
it can t happen like this .
okay ?
i ll meet you back at the hotel .
chandler .
oh , they re a hoot .
actually monica and i are engaged .
wait !
wait !
we d really love it if you could be there .
i know it would make me happy , ma am .
yeah .
thanks for making me do this .
when i was growing up i played the one on the far left .
hey !
you look great .
I am so glad we are having this rehearsal dinner , you know , i so rarely get to practice my meals before i eat them .
no stupid jokes .
i thought that was for the actual wedding .
you know what i just realized ?
we have no idea what we are doing in the wedding tomorrow .
heh .
this is like figure skating team all over again .
i mean synchronized swimming .
i mean   i mean the balance beam .
help me !
thank you .
i know , i hate being left out of things .
fine .
we are just sitting here .
alone .
doing nothing .
it is our rehearsal for tomorrow .
what happened ?
m me me me !
pick me , i look great in a tux and i will not steal focus .
oh , i will .
but i will need a mirror .
.
.
as he is me !
you are going downer !
i would not know , i did not make it !
mike did not tell you ?
you have to chose one of us to be in your wedding .
one of his groomsmen fell out .
just not enough to put us in the original wedding party .
hey , can i talk to you about this groomsman thing ?
if you pick ross , he will walk you down the isle just fine .
but if you choose me , you will be getting some comedy !
let me tell you why you need to pick me .
see , when i was a kid , i was always left out of everything , you know , and it really made me feel .
.
.
insecure .
you know , i was always picked last in gym .
even behind that big fat exchange student who did not even know the rules to baseball .
i mean , this guy would strike out and then run to third .
anyway , if I am the only one left out of this wedding , i just know that all those feelings are going to come rushing back .
y y yeeesss !
make groom  for chandler .
how is it going ?
that is what i was doing too .
you too .
me too .
I am not supposed to tell you .
you told us both we could be in the wedding ?
rach , rach , knock knock .
I will tell you at the wedding .
so technically , would this person be in the wedding ?
I am not scared .
I will just take little chappy and .
.
.
he can sense my fear .
my throat is exposed .
I will do it .
na ha ha .
.
.
ne he he .
.
.
ah ah .

oh yeah !

that really was an incredible wedding .
I would love to , but it is 2300 hours and I am about to have the most organized sex anyone's ever had .
i do not know .
maybe he hooked up with that hot girl he was talking to .
yeah , it was time .
the old condom ring in the leather just doesn t say  cool  anymore .
oh yeah , gym member .
i try to go four times a week , but i ve missed the last 1200 times .
you don t think i ve tried ?
you think i like having 50 dollars taken out of my bank account every month ?
no , they make you go all the way down there !
then they use all of these phrases and peppiness to try and confuse you !
then they bring out maria .
oh maria .
you can t say no to her , she s like this lycra spandex covered gym treat .
no !
oh no , you ll have to come .
why don t you just give him to somebody else ?
because that s the only part of you he can see when he s on the table !
yes .
yes !

i want a flabby gut and saggy man breasts !
okay .
i want to quit the gym .

i can t believe you didn t tell me !
you know that the two pillars of marriage are openness and honesty !
my god !
you must be good in bed !
she s okay with rachel and the baby ?
well , you have to honest with her !
otherwise you may think that you re going down the same path , but you re really going down different ones .
what ?
honey !
that s crazy !
i don t want you to get me a stripper  look , i appreciate it , but uh , it s a little creepy .
y know ?
i m not a bachelor anymore .
all right fine !
but i m only doing this for you !
and joey .
ah , no no no just ross .
ross and joey is embarrassing enough .
i understand : who would cancel an actual date to go to a fake bachelor party ?
what are you doing ?
okay .
i can t believe tomorrow s the big day .
you re right , this is more fun .
hi .
that s me .

that is funny , maybe for my birthday she ll murder someone .
oh actually , i d rather you yeah , go ahead .
we re going to have to burn that room down anyway .
why would she do that ?
this is the worst bachelor party ever !
in a minute ?
what s going to happen in a minute ?
!
why me ?
!
which is why you should do it .
you do it !
all right rock , paper , scissors who has to tell the who are to leave !
what ?
i don t think we ve actually done this before !
well we we still hang out .
well y know , things are different .
i m i m married now .
yeah , i miss that too .
i tell you what ; from now on we ll make time to hang out with each other .
her ass print is still on your grandmother s quilt , do you really want to talk about smoking ?
monica !
wait !
carry on .
could you not narrate ?
relax !
we will just get her some antacids .
oh my god !
next time , can i say breathe ?
where are you going ?
you can not leave me alone with her .
this is exactly the kind of social situation that i am not comfortable with !
it is just that we have never spent any time , you know , alone together .
okay .
so , ah .
.
.
any plans for the summer ?
hah .
may not want to mention this .
so , you ever wonder which is worse , you know ; going through labor or getting kicked in the nuts ?
well , it is just interesting .
you know , because no one will ever know , because no one can experience both .
one of life's great , unanswerable questions .
i mean , who knows ?
maybe there is something even more painful than those things ?
like this .
is it really that bad ?
I am okay .
alright .
wow , that is one disgusting miracle .
wow !
it is a baby !
a beautiful little baby !
and some other stuff I am going to pretend i do not see .
well , that is spongy .
i know .
he has your eyes .
i mean , i know that is not possible , but he does .
okay .
how do you feel ?
oh , yeah !
these are the faces of two people in the know !
well , gosh .
that makes me feel so special and good .
interesting !
can i see you for a second ?
what do we do ?
twins !
twins !
!
uh huh !
join me , will not you ?
!
okay , what do you say we keep one , and then just like have an option on the other one ?
why not ?
we could give each of them half a medallion , and then years later , they will find each other and be reunited .
i mean , that is a great day for everybody .
what if they are not ?
what if it is adopted by a king ?
monica , we are not ready to have two babies !
okay .
shhh .
.
.
okay .
okay !
she ?
it is a girl ?
well , now we have one of each !
and that is enough !
maybe .
unless they are like two people who have lived in apartments next to each other for years , and then one day they are pushed through a vagina and they meet .
bye !
have fun at church camp !
i know !
you ready to trade ?
okay .
we could trade later .
hey .
her name is erica .
yeah .
it is a shame you two did not get to spend more time together .
i love you .
i have no idea what is going on , but i am excited !
we were wondering what was taking so long with the gift , but now we understand you were doing this .
really ?
you got us a chick and a duck ?
oh , do not worry , we will find them .
alright .
it is okay , it is just an egg roll .
okay , let us find these birds .
well , that can not be good !
how ?
oh , tons , I am quite the woodsman .
joey , wait !
the ball !
i do not know .
maybe we can open this up somehow .
no .
.
.
it is all glued together .
i do not know .
maybe .
i know !
it is .
.
it is the foosball table .
did that movie ever get made ?
and we are also going to buy you tiny , bird hearing aids .
what is the matter ?
i understand .
i do not know .
except that , for one last time .
.
.
good game , good game , good game , good game , good game , good game , good game .
well , i can not do it either .
we have to bust it open , but neither of us can do it !
that was .
.
.
impressive .
sorry about the table , man .
you going to buy a new one ?
well , at least we got these little guys out .
aww , we were worried about you !
hm .
i guess i better get used to things crapping in my hand , huh ?
hey , you know what ?
maybe we should keep them here with you .
yeah , i mean we have got a lot going on right now .
and , plus , here they would have their own room .
you know , i    i think you are set with the poultry .
i think there may be another reason .
so , awkward hug or lame cool guy handshake ?
wow , this is weird .
where is ross ?
look around , you guys .
this was your first home .
and it was a happy place , filled with love and laughter .
but more important , because of rent control , it was a friggin ' steal !
oh , okay .
oh , it is going to be okay .
sure .
where ?
oh yeah , but do not worry .
i do not think anybody's going to focus on that as long as your wearing that towel dress .
all right , i suppose i can wait a day .
hey , what are you doing friday ?
i need you to come to this bachelor party for my weird cousin albert , y'know he is the botanist .
yeah .
is that a dinosaur tie ?
it must take you forever to find your keys .
hey , so can you make it on friday ?
well apparently albert has no friends .
he is very excited about the bachelor party though .
i think actually the only reason he is getting married is so he can see a stripper .
well , if the magician can open my beer with his but cheeks , then all right .
do not do anything .
keep it inside .
learn how to hide your feelings !
do not cry outloud .
i want to say you but , that seems like such an easy answer .
I will get you the cliff notes .
the abridgment .

all right fine , do not do anything , just sit here and talk to us , meanwhile she is talking to him about you .

y'know what , I am , I am going to spend some alone time with the pen .
oh , okay ross .

the check s in the mail !
oh your baby is so cute !
i can t wait to read your book ross !
!
what do you think she s just going to sit there quietly ?
you don t think she s going to want to make a toast ?

she s probably not going to even want to come .
no !
that was a lie !

we are excited to hear the speech but the rest of the time we are going to want to do , you know , island's stuff  .
yeah , that is the same as it has something to do with wind  .
she does ?
i would not read too much into it .
david , let me stop you there because i think i see where this is going .
I am not very good at giving advice .
so if you want advice , go to ross , monica , or .
.
.
joey , if the thing you want to advice about is pizza toppings or burning sensation when you pee .
seriously , we are going to do this ?
oh , because his penis was too big .
oh , I am sorry , that is the kind of thing i do .
they broke up because mike did not want to get married .
hey , what if you just let phoebe know you would be open to marriage ?
what ?
i did not mean now .
.
.
well , you are welcome !
glad i could help .
david , I am pretending to read here !
!
i do !
want a hint ?
huh ?
i do   i do  .
david is going to propose to phoebe .
be because , we were talking about ways that he could beat mike and i told him that phoebe wanted to get married .
i did !
a penis one !
look , just so i know , what was so wrong about what i said ?
man , that is some bad advice !
that is why our honeymoon photos look like me and diana ross !
tonight ?
!
is not an engagement ring supposed to have a diamond ?
oh , there it is !
nice !
monica , can i talk to you for a sec ?
david is going to propose to phoebe tonight !

.
.

what ?
may i ?
oh , no , no , no dear god , no !
your computer , i do not know wha .
.

i just feel awful .
well , i tried billy jean king , but .
.
.
you know , you and monica have the same I am going to kill you  look .
.

i can usually make it go away by kissing her .
.
.

phoebe is going to say yes  ?
that is , that is great !
and there is not chance that will work ?
oooooooh !
meddler !

you know , it is very hard to take you seriously when you look like that .
i think we have some time .
have you ever heard him talk ?
uh , phoebe , uh , i would be honoured , uh .
.
.
spit it out , david !
i would not brag too much about that thing , big guy .
oh , are not this nice ?
it is so quiet , i could just lie here all day .
I am so glad we have got adjoining rooms !
hey !
remember when i had corneas ?
ladies ?
ross's speech is in 45 minutes .
not to mention the cold sores .
really ?
i do not think so !
because you know how competitive you get and well , i say it is cute , others disagree , and I am lying !
oh , yeah ?
what happened when we played last time ?
and .
.
.

I am not playing with you .
she gets crazy !
this scar  is from pictionary !
oh dear god , there is two of them !
did you know this about him ?
ok !
honey , try to focus the trash talk on him !
do you really find this attractive on him ?
i think this is the first time in our marriage that I have felt like the more attractive one .
okay dokay , you have each won a game and I have lost what is felt like a year of my life .
so everybody goes home a winner .
should i use my invisibility to fight crime or for evil ?
ok , look !
enough is enough !
monica , that was also true an hour ago !
i mean , please , look at you !
your hand is blistered , you can barely stand , your hair is inexplicable !
ok , you have already proven you are just as good as he is , now we have missed our dinner reservations , so now let us just go upstairs , order room service , take a shower and shave your head !
but .
.
.
what about the obsessive cleaning ?
you ok ?
no , you did not .
because I am going to play for ya .
yes , i do .
now , i may not understand why you have to win so badly , but if it is important to you then it is important to me , because i love you .
you are welcome , sweetheart .

sudden death .
whoever wins this point , wins .
and that is .

i m watching the game , but i m not deaf !
y know , it s been a while since we ve screamed something .
maybe we should .
oh come on !
good game !
yeah .
solid effort .
solid effort .
detroit .
everybody at my school heard it !
you were the hermaphrodite cheerleader from long island ?
!
i m sorry .
when you were in high school you made out with a 50 year old woman ?
did she look 16 ?
well , she probably wasn t familiar with the process having spent most of her life sitting for oil paintings !
yes , i believe we can expect a call from the president any moment now .
couldn t i just say , this is ross ?
sorry !
joey !
joe !

that s why i replaced it with mine !
well , what did you think , that that elves came in and fixed it ?
i m gettin  my chair back !
joey you broke my chair !
!
i think i should get the chair !
because you  broke a chair and you  broke a chair !
the only one around here that hasn t broke a chair , is me !
well , where s the logic in that ?
!
so joey breaks my chair and i get nothing !
what are you guys ?
like a gang or something ?
!
treeger s snaking the shower drain .
hey !
do we pay for this ?
maybe we shouldn t pay our phone bill free phone sex .
yeah , joey just pressed something on the remote and it just , came on !
like finding money with naked people on it !
we don t know what could make this go away .
and no one touches the air around the tv !
we still have porn .
or a job where you don t have to carry a table .
it s the theme from good will humping .
oh oh , yeah , and did he also say that ah , some of the dialogue was corny and that he actually found it was funny and not sexy ?
they don t really talk to us about that kind of stuff .
i can get you some free white out though .

all right look , forget it , forget it .
you told her you love her , it s over .
what ?
okay .
good one .
hi !
listen , can we watch cartoons on your television ?
we need a porn break .
we spent the last two hours watching in  & out  & in , again .
because then we would be the guys who turned off free porn .
pregnant woman slays four ?
what s the second part of your plan ?
you put your fist through the wall ?
a place where no one will ever get out alive ?
are we in london ?
hey .
i was just at the bank , and there was this really hot teller , and she didn t ask me to go do it with her in the vault .
what , no , nice apartment , i bet the bedrooms are huge ?
y know what , we have to turn off the porn .
all right , ready ?

you want to see if we still have it ?
free porn !
!
!

!
!
okay , our news .
my company has asked me to head up our office in tulsa  , so as of monday I am being officially relocated .

I am sorry buddy , but i do not think I am going to be able to make it .

they are looking for someone to shovel mesquite .
'so cheesy ' also has an opening .
can i just say how much i appreciate you coming with me .
when we get to tulsa I am taking you for a great dinner at 'slim pickings ' .
'so cheesy ' ?
'whole hog ' ?
it is going to be tough to keep kosher in tulsa .
honey , we are leaving tomorrow you have still got a lot of packing to do .
what ?
how far outside ?
and you are thinking of taking it ?
so before you said being me with me was more important than any job , but i guess now it is old job ,  me ,  new job .
what happened to 'you can not live without me four days a week ' ?
i think you should take the job .
yeah .
i know it must be important to you when you start chattering like a monkey .
diagnostician or boo boo fixer ?
does he say that before he sticks his thermometer in your touchy ?
that was not a security blanket !
that was a wall hanging !

pheebs , if she could come back as a couch , we d really appreciate it .
she s not as pretty as she was when she was 29 .
no rach , it s not just you .
my thirtieth birthday certainly wasn t that much fun .
ross , a sports car ?
wouldn t it have been cheaper to just stuff a sock down there ?
would you put that back on ?
!
monica s going to be here any minute !
okay , for the last time .
it s not named for each individual man .
oh well , not as lovely as you .
i mean , i can t believe that you would have a thirty year old daughter !
and you !
i can t believe that you would have a tux that s thirty years old !
ohh !
okay !
okay !
everybody down !
everybody down !
okay , everybody stay here .
i will find out what s going on .
hey hey are you drunk ?

okay , here we go .
hey !
how d it go ?

hey oh , she is at home , putting up decorations for rachel's birthday party tonight .
i tried , but apparantly singing i will survive  in a helium voice    not helping .
yes , bravo on the hot nanny .
are you kidding ?
if i was not married she would be rejecting me right now .
now that rachel's gone ?
i was not staring .
i was leering .
looks like joey is doing allright with her .
seriously dude , 3 years ago .
you do not trust him ?
is this really your long term plan , for me to run interference ?
because i could get a job any day now .
allright , fine , but do not blame me if it does not work .
because you know as well as i do that once joey sets his mind on something , more often than not , he is going to have sex with it .
picturing that tree ?
where you going , joe ?
oh .
you mind if i join you ?
your thoughts ?
plural ?
I am afraid i can not let you do that , joe .
yes , as a matter of fact he did , so i can not let you go .
great novels ?
I am sorry , i got a little occupied .
right behind you , big guy !
first i was afraid , i was petrified   hi oh , well someone left this  .
this is yours ?
oh , uh , well , i have not seem it but if i do I will let you know .
hi !
we are just here to say goodbye , we are off to ohio .
and so incorrect !
uhm , thank you , but we are really trying not to get our hopes up .
yeah .
i mean , this girl could decide against adoption or she could like another couple better .
.
i can develop a condition in which i talk and talk and no one hears a word .
so we are standing firm on the 'not getting our hopes up ' ?
yes , but .
.
.
oh , screw it , I am going to be a daddy !
!
yeah .
just weird , you know .
it is like : hi , I am chandler .
may i have the human growing inside you ?
you are going to be great .
thank you so much for agreeing to see us .
ok .
that is what our friends call us .
i do not think that is exactly .
.
.
so , the fact that i am a doctor , and my wife s a reverend , that s important to you ?
plus i thought the baby would be in good hands with a doctor !
yeah , wow .
no ot for me it doesn t .
yeah , actually .
so , you read a file that you liked and you gave the agency the serial number and they contacted us ?
you should be .
you re really on top of stuff .
.
yeah , i did .
we are not signing those papers .
it is wrong .
they made a mistake .
they think we are somebody else .
you have got to stop !
she likes doctor chandler and reverend monica .
your veal chop is $34,95 !
but we are not the one she chose !
how can you feel okay about this ?
i know .
.
oh , honey .
.
monica , i want a baby too , but this woman is giving away her child .
she deserves to know who it is going to .
so , we will tell the truth and who knows , maybe she will like us for us .
you are jewish .
hey .
the agency must have made some mistake .
my wife is not a reverend and I am not a doctor .
i could perform an operation on you and prove it if you would like .
well , our names really are monica and chandler .
we are from new york .
erica wait !
you have every reason to be upset .
we did lie .
but only because we have been waiting and trying to have a baby for so long .
now we do not know how long it is going to be before we can get another chance again .
erica , please .
just consider us .
ask them to see our file .
our last name's bing .
my wife's a chef and I am in advertising .
but you did like us .
and you should .
my wife's an incredible woman .
she is loving and devoted and caring .
and do not tell her i said this but the woman's always right .
.
.
i love my wife more than anything in this world .
and i .
.
.
it kills me that i can not give her a baby .
.
.
i really want a kid .
and when that day finally comes , I will learn how to be a good dad .
but my wife .
.
.
she is already there .
she is a mother .
.
.
without a baby .
.
.
please ?
you still want that baby ?
eh .
.
.
, i don t , i don t know .
well , as old as he is in dog years , do you think snoopy should still be allowed to fly this thing ?
yeah ?
excuse me little one , i have a very solid backhand .
i was shrieking .
.
.
like a marine .
says here that a muppet got whacked on seasame street last night .
where exactly were around ten ish ?
look out kids , he s coming !
yes .
yes , and ah , ah , the trees are happy too , because for most of them , it s the only chance to see new york .
ahh , do you have any coconut flavoured deities ?
how .
.
.
exactly are you pursuing that ?
y'know other than sending out resumes like what , two years ago ?
he s right , if you quit this job , you then have motivation to go after a job you really want .
because , i m too afraid .
yeah , that d be much worse than being 28 , and still working here .
does this mean we re going to have to start paying for coffee ?
i spelled out boobies .
so , how many have you sold so far ?
oh my god , how did you do that ?
me !
on my computer .

well maybe you are going about this the wrong way .
you know i mean think about it .
single white male , divorced three times , what are doing ?

i do not want you putting any ideas in her head .
wh wh why ?
!
yeah , so , what is that supposed to mean ?
!
i do not see it that way .

by me ?
monica .
just tell me what i need to do to make things right .

y'know , i i mess up and then you tell me how to fix it and then i do and then y'know you think I am all cute again .
where is monica ?
!
where is she ?
i need to talk to her !
it is urgent !
is she here ?
i need to talk to you , it is urgent !
okay , I have been doing a lot of thinking about us , y'know a lot of uhh , us thinking .
and uh , well i guess there is only one one way to do this .
monica  will you marry me ?
i do not know .
but i know I am not afraid to do this .
I am doing this because I am sorry ?
no , the best reason to get married is pregnancy .
sorry is pretty much fourth y'know , behind being ready and actually wanting to get married .
will you be my wife ?
yeah , I am kind of wishing everyone was not here right now .
yeah i know , but i was really confused and then i talked to these guys .
i did not think i was !
well i would have been happy because i would have be able to spend the rest of my life with the woman that i love .
or , you would have seen a chandler shaped hole in that door .
okay , how long is this going to go on .
that is not funny .
hey !
monica and i are celebrating our ten month anniversary , we have got reservations at ja george .
made a few calls , pulled some strings , and they agreed to seat us at 11:30 if we both had the chicken and did not get desert .
hey caitlin !
somebody got a haircut .
yeah , if that was true , gym class would have been a lot more interesting .
oh , okay .
here you go .
oh , he is in the back .
the duck pissed him off , said that eggs came first .
okay , bye !
what ?
i was not flirting .
okay first of all , the impression , uncanny .
and second , that was not flirting , that was just casual conversation between two people .
that is all .
you want to see flirting ?
I will show you flirting .
i was not flirting .
i was not and oh god , shh !
is that what this is about ?
you like caitlin ?
so , joey on law  & order , you must be very proud !
I am sorry , i thought you were joey's other grandmother .
I have done it again .
happy anniversary , 10 months !
uhh , joey's grandmother is right there .
the one that does not .
hey , why do not you wear those earrings i gave you ?
okay .
if you said , big lima bean , bubbling up .
would she understand the difference ?
here you go .
now stop bringing us pizzas you .
you are welcome .
what ?
thank you for that !
i was not flirting .
really ?
!
so umm , you you flirt with guys all the time ?
okay , but there is a big difference .
you are a lot hotter than i am .
yes , it does bother me !
and i think it would bother a lot of people .
rachel , when you were going out with ross , did it bother you when he flirted with other women ?
well , what is it ?
if we keep talking this way , are not we going to freak her out soon ?
does not know , hello .
but she knows capricorn one .
so uh monica , do you , do you like the law  & order ?
see , I am finding out all this stuff about you today , like you like the law  & order and that you flirted with every guy in the tri state area !
oh , I am so glad we cleared that up .
look , I am sorry , some things are different for men and for women .
okay , I have already taught you so much already , but whatever .
see when you flirt with a guy you think , I am just flirting , no big deal .
but the guy is thinking , finally !
somebody who wants to sleep with me !
it is true .
again true .
all guys that are awake .
then we go to sleep and then all the guys from the other end of the world wake up and behave the exact same way .
uh , joey is going to be right back .
right back !
meanwhile , let us let us let us talk about you .
so , you are old and small .
okay , hold on .
okay .
if this is the way all the gellers flirt , we do not have a problem .
oh the humanity .
more so than anything else .
almost over man .
why am i looking ?
you could not have at least changed your shirt .
ground control to major tom !
commencing countdown engines on !
hey !
you ready ?
you look amazing .
I am the luckiest man in the world .
let me see the earrings .
they look great !
does your boyfriend have the best taste or what ?
thanks for picking out the earrings man .
maybe the problem was you were pronouncing it kara tay .
sure i would !
what , you guys really think that i m that shallow ?
what if i had had the guts to quit my job ?
i d probably be writing for the new yorker , getting paid to be funny .
but my job s fun too !
i mean tomorrow , i i don t have to wear a tie .
hey .
oh i just got another rejection letter .
they said my writing was funny , just not archie comic funny .
was his question what s more boring than him ?
hey , i may have no money , but i still have my pride .
ehh .
i could use the money ; it could give me time to write .
okay !
all right !
hey .
well it s kind of hard to be friends with drake because of his busy schedule and the fact that he s not real .
uh oh , it s my boss !
drop off my dry cleaning .
pick up my vitamins .
teach me how to spell vitamins .
wear in my new jeans .
what ?
but the kit kats are all right ?
!
phoebe , are you having a heart attack ?
!
i always thought having a heart attack was nature s way of telling you to die !
but you re not going to die .
i mean , you are going to die , but you re not going to die today .
i wish i was dead .
oh just great .
he beeps me now with codes .
one is , bring me food .
two is , i m with a girl , bring us food .
three is , i m lost and i can t find food .
here you go joe , here s the freshly squeezed orange juice you asked for .
yeah ?
i m sorry , i guess i just like the pulp .
okay , anything for you sir ?
it s not all juice !
who sold a story to archie comics ?
!
aww .
you want to share it ?
what s this ?
aww , thanks man .
oh you wouldn t uh , care .
it s just a stupid comic book story .
well uh , archie needs money to fix his jalopy  , uh but he doesn t want reggie to just give him the money .
so reggie hires him as his assist as his butler .
and then makes him do all these crazy things like bring him milkshakes that can t have lumps in them .
no , the doctors say it may kill her .
but i think we should tell her .
listen phoebe , he s right .
people are not supposed to have heart attacks at 31 .
uh , what about y know the massage thing ?
that never gave you a heart attack .
i m sorry you re here with me instead of roger .
well , i could make it seem like he s here .
here s some little known facts about cous cous .
they didn t add the second cous until 1979 .
okay .
what was tonight ?
okay .
what was tonight ?
with roger ?
not just with roger ?
!
oh my god !
four different women !
i ve had sex way more times !
nine .
well good , good for you .
you really think that roger is the perfect guy ?
hey that s what i tell girls about me .
no you are not !
you are sweet and wonderful and this is going to happen for you .
okay .
so was i .
we can t do this .
yeah !
if if if we did do this there would be a lot of pressure on me , y know ?
because you ve been waiting a very long time and i wouldn t want to disappoint you .
i do like that .
well , if it helps there were only three .
so it would just be for tonight , right ?
stop it !
we re doing this !
let s do it !
okay !
i have some moves .
yeah , let s just forget it .
okay !
oh yeah .
yeah ?
oh my god !
oh , okay !
hey !
let me tell you about this chick i scored with last night !
oh no wait a minute that was you !
so you uh , want to do something tonight ?
oh .
oh right !
right !
because you re still seeing him and uh , he s a good guy .
i mean , i remember a time when   yeah !
totally !
totally , and you ?
i bet he can .
oh yeah !
yeah !
don t worry about me , i ll be fine !
okay to come in ?
yeah i know , guess who beeped him ?
i m the ruptured spleen .
because you shouldn t be with him .
you should be with me .
yeah !
when you were talking about roger , that was killing me !
look , things like last night they don t just happen .
y know ?
or at least not to me .
or with the other two women , in the morning y know i was just lying there and i couldn t wait to just go hang out with my friends , but with you i always y know with a friend .
i know you probably don t want to go out with me , y know because i make too many jokes and i ve never been in a serious relationship and i guess i m not technically a doctor   no , there were two .
oh yeah .
yes , joey's made arrangements to have his baby in a movie from the 50's .
you have to pick your moments .
i used to have that bumper sticker .
you see what i mean .
mmmm .
not tonight , honey .
i got an early day tomorrow .
oh , ok , because we never do that .
you will get one .
all right .
I will tell you what .
when we are 40 , if neither one of us are married , what do you say you and i get together and have one ?
oh , no , no .
i just meant hypothetically .
no , no , no .
uh , uh .
dear god !
this parachute is a knapsack !
rachel , what is the deal with you and doctors , anyway ?
was , like , your father a doctor ?
no reason .
where have you been ?
mazel tov !
you are really frightening me .
somebody want to help me , tryin ' to rip out my heart .
uh , that is great .

i know , i still am one of these .
and sometimes , I will want you to steal third , and I will go like this .

up  til now , the worst thing i ever saw , was my father doing tequila shots off the naked houseboy .
after this , i would gladly make that my screensaver !
i can do that .
okay .
now all we ve got to do is get rid of this chair .
oh , i know !
poor ross .
oh , great .
we have to watch him do yoga in his underwear , but for this he closes the drapes !
oh , and we should warn you , before you watch it : don t watch it .
well , let s just say it s ironic how footage of someone being born can make you want to kill yourself .
this reminds me of a very specific part of the tape .
okay , here we go .
why have i seen this thing three times ?
!
wait , you guys , look !
no , the baby s out !
look , look !
and look how happy the mom is now !
okay , well tonight s the big night .

then when the glasses are full , instead of proposing a toast i m just going to propose .
yeah .
i m not going to mess it up .
she s not going to say no .
hey !

phoebe !
hi monica .
hey !
well , monica and chandler can t go .

i didn t agree to that !
will you marry me ?

i m good !
are you good ?
are you good ?
is everything are you are you perrr perfect ?
!
oh , yeah .
uh , no you can t have my jacket !

if you thought that you were going to be cold , you should ve brought your own jacket .
but uh , other than that , are you okay ?
are you okay ?
yes !
i m fine .
in fact i ve been fine for a long time now and i think , the reason is you .
okay umm , before i meant you i had really little life and i couldn t imagine growing old with   i know , but just let me say it .
what ?
!
i m chandler !
oh , that s richard !
hey hey , hey !
i don t know why i did that !
and uh , you don t have a mustache which is good .
i m chandler ; i make jokes when i m uncomfortable .
hi .
richard !
no one supposed to know about us !
see i , did it again .
yeah , i ll sit down .
yes .
i got a good one , i got a good one !
i once walked in on both my parents making love to the same guy .
what ?
!
before you say anything , have we got a story for you !
guess who we bumped into at dinner !
richard !
oh you knew that .
good !
for camp !
hey , you have to forget about elizabeth .
i mean if you re not careful you may not get married at all this year !
what did you guys just do ?
!
richard was there so i couldn t do it !
i m going to do it tomorrow y know , and and surprise her , but now you ve ruined it !
who walks into a room and asks to see a person s hands ?
!
this is terrible .
what am i going to do ?
that s right , i can throw her off .
i can make her think marriage is the last thing on my mind .
i can do that , i ve had 30 years of practice .
okay , okay , here she comes !
how do i look ?
do i look like a guy who doesn t want to get married ?
hey !
oh , just hanging out , talkin  about uh , websites .
yeah , we saw this really interesting website about marriage and how totally unnecessary it is and how its just a way for the government to keep tabs on you .
yeah , well  y know , it just got me thinking though , why would anybody ever want to get married huh ?
eh  sure i do .
in fact , i think the whole concept of marriage is unnatural .
i mean look at pigs .
let s take a second here and look at pigs .
okay pigs don t mate for life .
i mean a pig can have like a hundred sexual partners in a lifetime , and that s just an ordinary pig not even a pig that s good at sports !
if marriage worked , i d be all for it .
but do you know what the divorce rate in this country is ?
97 % .
well , never say never but y know probably uh yeah , never .
whoa !
whoa !
whoa !
what is all this pressure ?
!
is this some new kind of strategy ?
why don t you put down your copy of  the rules  huh mantrap ?
!
it s okay , i got a plan .
i was making a coconut phone with the professor .
what ?
!
my oh my god !
he s not supposed to ask my girlfriend to marry him !
i m supposed to do that !
well what  y know what i m going to do ?
i m going to go over there ; i m going to kick his ass !
will you help me ?
!
you re right .
okay .
i m going to get the ring !
i m going to get the ring !
i m going to go find her and  i m just going to propose !
okay great .
what ?
!
where is she ?
i m not scared of you !
scotch on the rocks , with a twist , on a coaster ?
ha ha , monica !
monica !
well where did she go ?
oh my god , i can t believe this !
y know , i thought i thought you were a good guy .
nothing happened ?
nothing ?
so you didn t tell my girlfriend that you love her ?
y know what ?
i can t believe this !
do you know what you did ?
my girlfriend is out there thinking things over !
you made my girlfriend think !
!
and what does she have to think about ?
i love her !
but i am willing to offer her all those things .
this was just a plan , y know ?
a way to throw her off course so that when i offered her all these things , she d be surprised !
it was working until you showed up , you big tree !
i mean , this isn t fair .
you had your chance with her !
you had your chance and you blew it !
and this is my chance and i am not going to blow it because we are meant for each other !
and this is all just been one stupid mistake !
i was going to propose tonight .
yeah i even  got a ring .
did you get a ring ?
y know richard you are a good guy .
i can t talk to you now , i got to find monica !
what ?
what are you talking about ?
well why didn t you stop her ?
!
why didn t you just tell her it was a plan ?
!
well where  where did she go ?
i can t believe i ruined this .
oh my god .
okay !
okay !
okay !
oh god , i thought   wait a minute , i i can do this .
i thought that it mattered what i said or where i said it .
then i realized the only thing that matters is that you ,  you make me happier than i ever thought i could be .
and if you ll let me , i will spend the rest of my life trying to make you feel the same way .
monica , will you marry me ?
huh .
morning .
yeah , like there is any way i could ever do that .
hey , you know what , here is a thought .
why do not you stay home from work today and just hang out with me .
i can not believe that i am going out with someone that is getting divorced .
I am such a grown up .
well , maybe i will not kiss you , and then you will have to stay .
nope , not this time .
I am not yanking you .
yeah , i know .
she makes me happy .
I am not breaking up with her !
hey !
of !
you know , you should really go on this show .
all right , listen , i got three tickets to the rangers tonight .
what did ya ' say ?
no , janice .
you know , i may be way out on a limb here , but do you , do you , have a problem with janice ?
ooh , that girl that i hate , eww , drives me crazy , eww , eww , oh !
well , there you go .
well , I am crazy about her now .
i think this could be the real thing .
capital 'are ' !
capital 't ' !

four hours ?
you guys have been doing this for four hours ?
all right , let me in .
what ?
I am not a dropper !
it is throwing and catching !

yeah , you almost overreacted to something .
not fun anymore ?
come on !
gary's such a great guy !
whatever the problem is , you can work it out !
oh that is over !
you guys want to eat here ?
y'know , how did i get this reputation as a dropper ?

I am anything but a dropper .
you know me sir .
oh ah , i do have a question for ya .
do you know how i get around the office computer network so i can access the really good internet porn ?
what s funny about that ?
hey that s okay .
so , where do you want to go ?
the hard rock caf  ?
again ?
!
you like the purple rain display !
hey bob .
yeah , he thinks that s my name .
oh it s been going on way to long now .
y know , i mean the first time he said it we were just passing each other in the hallway , so i didn t say anything .
and then the next time he said , hey toby , do you want a donut ?
and i i wanted a donut .
and now it s five years later , the donut s gone and i m still toby .
no !
that would be so awkward !
look besides , we work in different departments .
he s on the sixth floor y know ?
so he calls me toby once in a while .
what s the big deal ?
it could be worse , it s not like he s calling me muriel .
shh !
it is a family name !
hey bob .
if i see him , i ll ask .
yeah !
we re on a semi first name basis .
bob ?
ooh , working here with us ?
everyday ?
yeah , i don t know if he has what it takes .
but this is eleven .
it s almost twice as hard up here .
i think it s best sir .
y know what you should do , just toss  them in the shedder and claim you never got  them .
what does a guy have to do to be taken seriously around here ?
!
sure , what s up ?
hey bobby .
uhh yeah .
yeah , it s  right , right down there .
right there , yeah .
can i ask you why ?
okay bob listen uhh , i m the reason you didn t get the job up here .
bob !
well that puts me in a difficult position .
bob .
bob !
bob !
!
!
what the hell are you doing ?
!
thanks !
joey , we would have asked you , we just thought you would not be interested .
so excited about your letter !
so you must be going to somewhere fancy to celebrate ?
that is where people make number two !
!
i don t .
.
.
uh .
.
.
understand .
on every word ?
and that became  they are humid prepossessing homo sapiens with full sized aortic pumps .
.
.
?
you know what ?
you don t need a thesaurus , just write from here ,  your full sized aortic pump .
i doubt that !
tell her about us last year .
word !
she is right !
if i were a guy and .
.
.
did i just say if i were a guy .
.
?
oh , i do not think it was desperate , i think it was amazing !
sounds good to me .
.
.
but what would a guy think ?
hey joe !
how is the second draft of the letter coming ?
can we read it ?
can you print out another copy ?
it is ok , it is ok .
you know what ?
I will just call the agency and tell them to throw out the letter .
hello , this is chandler bing .
somebody just dropped off a handwritten recommendation letter , and .
.
uh huh .
.
.
uh huh .
.
.
okay .
.
.
thank you .
good bye .
.
they loved it .
they thought it was very smart of us to have a child write the recommendation letter .
she guessed 8 , 9 , based on his drawings .
that sounds like fun .
i think she looks cute .
.
.
.
but i am wrong !
like war .
or that thing in joey's refrigerator .
remember ?
it was in a milk carton but it looked like meat ?
hey !
monica can be cool and fun at organized indoor projects !
wow !
fortunately she has a very pretty face !
oh , i can not believe my sperm have low motility because , let me tell you , when i was growing up they sure seem to be in a hurry to get places !
!
hi .
oh , damn it !
is that a hint ?
because we love you doctor connelly but we do not think we would want you to be our child !
wow , talking about an inhospitable environment !
hey guys !
i think i can safely say that we all have family issues , work stuff and/or are sick .
but you come first !
ok .
not as much fun as last time .
apparently you only get porn if you are giving a sperm sample .
well .
.
.
there is surrogacy , but monica has dreamt her whole life of carrying a child , she has felt that watching a surrogate would be .
.
.
too hard for her .
yeah .
aside from adoption the only other choice is insemination , so .
.
.
we are talking about sperm donors .
ah ha !
i wish there was an easier way for us to have a child but i do not think there is one .
hey !
look i brought a friend for dinner , this is zack , from work !
you guys have not actually met before , but , boy !
you are both polite !
go to have a seat zack , and I will get you a beer .
so , zack's pretty nice , uh ?
so , how would you like to have a baby that is half yours and half his !
well , we are talking about sperm donors and zack may be the guy !
i mean , look , he is intelligent , he is healthy , he is athletic , i mean , he is spermtastic  !
no , i invited him to dinner so you could get a chance to get to know him !
i mean , if we go through a sperm bank you never meet the guy , get to check him out .
I am telling you , he is great !
i mean , even if my sperm worked fine , I would think he would be the way to go !
ok !
zack !
so what do you think ?
i want that guys genes for my kid !
those eyes , those cheeckbones !
you do not like him .
alright !
just follow my lead !
oh !
thanks , I am crazy about our place .
hey !
speaking of crazy .
.
.
do you have a history of mental illness in the family ?
that is really not the kind of thing we are looking for zack .
you know what is not funny ?
male pattern baldness  i noticed you were enjoying that ravioli with a beautiful set of teeth .
did you have braces as a child ?
we are teeth people zack !
you sure you do not want to stick around a little longer ?
are you just tired now or are you always tired , because that could be a sign of clinical depression .
ok .
i think we have found our sperm !
yeah , you think so , well ?
should i ask him ?
why not , just because his great grandmother was obese , our kids are going to get that from you anyway !
yeah , he is better !
really ?
are you sure ?
thank god , because i do not want to do this either .
you know , i was just doing because i thought that was what you wanted to do .
you know , I am the husband , I am supposed to .
.
.
bring the sperm .
so you know this leaves us with .
.
.
how do you feel about that ?
me too .
i want to find a baby that needs a home and i want to raise it with you .
and i want to mess it up in our own specific way .
yeah .
we are going to be great parents .
wait , if we are lucky , and we are really really really quiet , we may be able to hear the sound of a condom breaking !
hey , zack !
look , i just wanted to apologize for last night .
i got the feeling we made you a little uncomfortable .
really ?
my wife and i have some boundary issues , you know , sometimes we ask inappropriate questions .
we are working on it .
you would not know if jeanette's planning on keeping her baby , would ya ?
that is funny .
it was also funny when i made it up .
i made that joke up .
yes , i did .
i told it to dan at work , and he said it was the funniest joke he d ever heard .
monica , you remember me telling you that joke , right ?
seriously ?
yeah , i guess .
hey , joey , playboy printed my joke .
it s my joke .
dude , you have got to turn on behind the music .
the band heart is having a really tough time , and i think they may break up .
nah , monica s watching some cooking show .
come on , i don t want to miss when they were skinny .
what ?
no , i want to watch this .
.
did your cable go out ?
joey , why is your cable out ?
if you need money , will you please please just let me loan you some money ?
whoa ho .
all right , you want to see if the joke stealer will let us watch the show at his place ?
paid your phone bill ?
yeah .
so , you heard it , you repeated it , so that must mean you wrote it .
and monkeys can t write out prescriptions .
you are not allowed to laugh at my joke .
so , you stole my joke , and you stole my money .
well , she is going to know that you stole the joke .
yeah !
okay  .
he took my joke , he took it .
you know who else picked rachel ?
ross , and you know what else ross did ?
he stole my joke .
you know what ?
i m going to get a joke journal .
y know ?
and document the date and time of every single one of my jokes .
yeah !
picking rachel .
maybe it s the sound of ross climbing into my brain and stealing my thoughts .
so is your apron .
you re wearing it like a cape .
i think it s great that you work here .
you re going to make a lot of money , and here s your first tip : don t eat yellow snow .
.
ah ha ha , 2:15 , coffeehouse .
it s my joke .
let s have monica decide .
yeah !
mon , get out here !
okay , okay .
you have to help us decide whose joke this is .
because you re the only one that can be fair .
don t try to sway her .
i m your only chance to have a baby .
okay , let s go .
okay , i thought of the joke two months ago at lunch with steve .
can i finish my story ?
!
so steve said he had to go to the doctor .
and steve s doctor s name is doctor muppy .
so i said ,  doctor monkey ?
and that is how the whole doctor monkey thing came up .
i m not arguing with that .
is not .
hi , oh hi .
monica is a self sufficient , together lady .
being with her has been like being on a vacation .
and what may be perceived as high maintenance is merely attention to detail and generosity of spirit .
i m out of words .
should i just say the whole thing again ?
you re a little high maintenance .
i m sorry .
you re not easy going , but you re passionate , and that s good .
and when you get upset about the little things , i think that i m pretty good about making you feel better about that .
and that s good too .
so , they can say that you re high maintenance , but it s okay , because i like   maintaining you .
i m off the list .
hey , buddy boy , how d the audition go ?
hey .
joey !
no way .
i m not answering that .
hey , that monkey's got a ross on its ass !
might want to open with the snowman .
nothing for you , you have paolo .
you do not have to face the horrible pressures of this holiday : desperate scramble to find anything with lips just so you can have someone to kiss when the ball drops !
!
man , I am talking loud !
it is just that I am sick of being a victim of this dick clark holiday .
i say this year , no dates , we make a pact .
just the six of us   dinner .
y'know , i was hoping for a little more enthusiasm .
that guy's going home with a note !
wait a minute , wait a minute , i see where this is going , you are going to ask him to new year's , are not you .
you are going to break the pact .
she is going to break the pact .
yeah , because i already asked janice .
i snapped , okay ?
i could not handle the pressure and i snapped .
I am not saying it was a good idea , I am saying i snapped !
too many jokes .
.
.
must mock joey !
aah , y'killing me !
y'know , if you are going to work late , i could look in on him for you .
okay , but if he asks , I am not going to lie .
fun bobby ?
your ex boyfriend fun bobby ?
i happen to know a fun bob .
that is so weird , i had such a blast with him the other night .
yeah , we played , we watched tv .
.
that juggling thing is amazing .
with the balled up socks ?
i figured you taught him that .
y'know , it was not that big a deal .
he just balled up socks .
.
.
and a melon .
.
.
you remember janice .
but you found me !
kill me .
kill me now .
alright , janice , that is it !
janice .
.
.
janice .
.
.
hey , janice , when i invited you to this party i did not necessarily think that it meant that we   I am sorry you misunderstood .
.
.
oh , will you give me the thing .
and then the peacock bit me .
please kiss me at midnight .
ooh .
uh , i do not know how to tell you this , but she is in monica's bedroom , getting it on with max , that scientist geek .
ooh , look at that , i did know how to tell you .
and the moment of joy is upon us .
y'know , i uh .
.
just thought I would throw this out here .
I am no math whiz , but i do believe there are three girls and three guys right here .
alright , somebody kiss me .
somebody kiss me , it is midnight !
somebody kiss me !
hey !
ready to go ?
what are you doin ' ?
great , a faster way to tell people that I am unemployed and childless  .
the tall girl who would not sleep with you ?
bet she would sleep with you now .
.
.
let me see what you wrote about yourself : doctor paleontology , two kids .
.
.
you split with carol because you have different interests ?
.
.
.
i think you split with carol because you have one very similar interest !
maybe we finish this for him !
also i cloned a dinosaur in my lab .
she is now my girlfriend .
i do not care what society says .
it is the best sex I have ever had  .
.
.
aaand send !
oh , I am so sorry !
you are not going to need my help ?
oh good , because I have already thought of 3 .
.
.
4 !
I have just thought of a fourth  i believe i read that somewhere !
i respectfully disagree .
who cares ?
nobody reads those things i do not have a page .
because i told everyone he slept with dinosaurs .
would you get that please ?
people have been calling to congratulate me all day .
hang up , hang up .
and that was a great movie !
I am so going to get back at ross .
.
.
oh yeah , this will show him , here we go  .
oh , you will see my friend .
and so young .
well , how you died was funny .
it kills over one americans every year .
you want to talk about people's feelings ?
you should have heard how hurt professor stern was yesterday when i told him i would not be able to go with him to key west !
hey , ross , i just wanted to apologize .
.
.
do not tell me you actually made those gay pictures of me ?
huh !
so that is what i would look like if i worked out .
.
.
and was being serviced by a policeman .
you are not actually going to send these out are ya ?
no , come on , you know that is not true .
well , the gay community is a lot more vocal than the dead community .
alright look , let us think about this , ok , do you really think that people are going to stir up your family at this tragic time ?
that people are going to post condolences on a website ?
this is not about people not caring that you are dead .this is about people not having a decent outlet for their grief .
right , i mean , come on , I am sure that if you had a funeral or a memorial service , tons of people would come .
ross , what are you .
.
.
what are you .
.
.
what are you doing ?
you are having a memorial service for yourself !
?
ross , do not press send , do not press se .
.
.
!
there you go !
someone came !
please , come in .
oh yes , yes .
.
.
let me .
.
.
take your coat .
at least he died doing what he loved .
.
.
watching blimps  some guy , tom gordon .
ok tommy , that is enough mourning for you !
here we go , bye bye !
!
ok !
please , one ridiculous problem at a time !
you gave them one day's notice , not everyone in our class checks the web site everyday and monica .
.
.
it is probably the way you stand !
oh , that is not true .
you had an impact on me , i mean , it is 15 years later and we are still best friends .
does not that count for something ?
I am sure it is somebody for you .
now , go hide .
kori ?
kori weston ?
wow !
you look amazing !
chandler , chandler bing .
I am not gay , I am not gay at all .
do not listen to him , he is in a really bad mood !
i did not know ross and you were so close .
I am sure that would mean a lot to him .
and if heaven has a door , I am sure he is pressing his ear up against it and listening intently .
hey .
someone on the subway licked my neck !
licked my neck !
!
what are you guys doing ?
oooh , i m afraid that does not exist .
no , there are great pictures of you standing next to a guy who s going like this   i don t know what it is , i just can t take a good picture .
yeah , i m not in that .
all right , but i should warn you , i m not going .
i m going .
how about those three pointers ?
and those guys were this  close to lettin  us play this time too .
yes , and we call ross lingers in the bathroom .

hey , i had a terrible childhood and i don t do porn .
her ankle is what you re watching ?
she s just doing her job !
hey !
there s no back to this couch !
yeah i know , but i figured a shot y know ?
maybe one of those stories would make me cry and then you wouldn t think i was y know , all dead inside .
oh that makes me feel so warm in my hollow tin chest .
no , i mean , come on , seriously think about it , we get married , we re up at the altar and i m like this .
yeah ?
okay , well i won t uh , worry about this anymore then .
aww , i love you so  what ?
!
so you didn t mean any of that ?

i just don t see why those two can t work things out !
i i can t believe jill s gone .
i can t help it , i opened a gate .
hey .
yes !
yes !
a thousand times , yes !
oh , it s awkward .

i m not even getting married !
okay , this is a question for science fiction writers !

central perk ?
okay , okay , a little announcement , i just want everyone to know that the position of my best man is still open !
and uh ,  so is the position of the bride .
what ?
ugh .
just a sec , give me a minute to wake up for this ah ha ha !
!
you lost the ring !
you re the worst best man ever !
you slept with the stripper ?
hey !
so you might say , the ring is irreplaceable ?
so you might say , it s a magic ring .
well , i think it all started when you said , hey joey , why don t you be my best man .
well , what if we just ah , called her , used a fake name , and had her come to my office ?
you be cool .
way to be cool , man .
marry me .
he will , joe .
hey , come on , it s not your fault .
no , you should .
really ?
thanks man .
what a baby .
hi !
how come ?
do you have any ideas ?
oh , and you know whose knowledge of her ex boyfriend is shocking ?
monica !
oh , well .
.
.
maybe I will join them some time .
i just hope the club does not slip out of my hand and beat the moustache off his face .
so how come richard's selling the place ?
went bankrupt ?
medical malpractice ?
choked on his own moustache ?
mmm that is enough about you !
no , no , no , no , no , no !
no , no .
.
.
we are not together .
we are not a couple .
we are definately not a couple .
we are not going to have this conversation again .
.
.
look at this place .
why am i so intimidated by this guy ?
pretentious art , this huge macho couch .
when we know all he does is sit around all day crying about losing monica to a real man !
you do not think he is here , do you ?
look at these videos .
you know , i mean , who does he think he is ?
magnum force , dirty harry , cool hand luke .
.
.
oh my god !
there is a tape here with monica's name on it .
get there faster !
I am not going to watch it .
.
.
i do not need to watch it .
.
.
i mean , what good could possibly come from watching ?
well , we know I am going to watch it .
do not judge me , I am only human !
i had to !
okay , imagine you were married .
.
.
and you found a tape of your wife in another guys ' apartment .
.
.
would not you need to know what was on it ?
some girl .
.
.
!
?
yeah .
.
.
!
?
allright , I am going to watch it .
.
.
i mean look , it is probably not even what i think it is .
.
.
and even if it is .
.
.
it can not possibly be as bad as what I am picturing in my head .
.
.
can it ?
then you are going to have to watch it for me .
just for a few seconds , so i can know what it is .
.
.
please ?
why am i hearing cheering ?
football ?
just football ?
it is football .
.
.
it is just football .
.
.
this is great !
this is the first time I have ever enjoyed football .
.
.
it may be customary to get a beer .
.
.
what the .
.
.
what are you doing ?
whoho ho .
.
.
listen to the judgement from the porn star !
because that is who i am , okay ?
I am sure a mature man like richard could see a tape like that and it would not bother him .
just'd be another saucy anecdote for him to share at his men's club over brandy and moustaches .
this is about you and richard .
he is clearly not over you .
he keeps a tape so he can .
.
.
look at it whenever he wants .
oh , yeah , well , poor richard .
y ' .
.
.
i can grow a moustache !
yeah , oh , but i just keep picturing you rolling around with him with your cowboy boots in the air .
.
.
oh , good , good .
play more , because i want to see how it ends .
what .
.
.
?
that is not you !
life is good again !
ride  them cowgirl !
is that a problem ?
what are you crazy ?

i feel so used .
i would never lie to get someone into bed .
i suppose that monica will have the   manipulative shrew .
you mean the lully story ?
oh yeah , that s what she says .
but maybe you re not ovulating at all , maybe it s just a clever ruse to get me into bed .
you not going to believe this : she lied !
she tricked me into having sex with her .
what s the matter with me ?
why i m such a girl ?
so you never had sex with a kennedy , have you ?
oh !
she s growing inside you .
oh !
i think that s the youngest girl ever to reject me .
oh hey !
no .
i mean i believe that uh , certain people are more suited for each other and i believe in falling in love , but soul mates , i don t think they exist .
why ?
what ?
come on , don t be crazy .
you don t think there s someone out there better suited for monica than me , do ya ?
a tall guy with hair similar to mine , oh unknowable universe !
luckily , the guy she settled for can t hear what you re talking about .
you believe that this guy is destined for someone else and you re still going to date him ?
what ?
what s wrong with sun dried tomatoes ?
on a barbecue chicken pizza ?
no ?
what are you doing ?
!
i believe in tall , handsome strangers who hit on my wife !
cheese you say ?
that s some pretty smelly work , huh don ?

i ll just be over here , browsing through the personals .
yeah , fine .
fine .
not perfect !
!
but good enough .
i m sorry , did you say cheese ?
phoebe thinks you and don are soul mates , and i don t believe in that kind of stuff .
but then you two totally get along .
so look , i won t stand in your way if you want to run off with don and live in a house of cheese .
no .
but i m sure   tomatoes  does .

phoebe , did you see that ?

i need a walk .
it is to me .
you wanted to sleep with batman , and instead you had to settle for robin .

it came for me but it would probably rather sleep with you !
look joe , i know you wanted to do the wedding  how can i not be upset ?
okay ?
i finally fall in love with this fantastic woman and it turns out that she wanted you first !
that s what you should say .
when you re marrying us ; that s what you should say .
i d love it if you would do it .
but those are the words !
those exact words !
yeah , we talked and monica made me see that i over reacted a little bit and some things in life are more important .
hey !
wow , it is true what they say , pregnant bellies look like a drum .
all right .
wouldn t that be frank the iii ?
hey !
do we have a baby name yet ?
well , it certainly worked for that valdez kid .
hey , y know what , if you re going to do that , if you re going to name him joey , you should name him chandler .
oh , come on !
chandler s funny , sophisticated , and he s very loveable , once you get to know him .
well , chandler will be there for you too .
i mean , well , he might be a little late , but but , he ll be there .
and he ll bring you some cold soda , if want you need him for is that you re really hot .
hey !
and now you re giving me the message !
you actually think that something can happen between emily and susan ?

this is emily .
emily is straight .
raymond chandler .
okay , there are no famous joey s .
except for , huh , joey buttafucco .

am i a mark , or a john ?
all right look , am i serious , okay ?
tomorrow at 3:30 i am going down to the courthouse .
hey , look , this name has been holding me back my entire life .
okay , it s probably why kids picked on me in school , and why i never do well with women  so , as of 4 of clock tomorrow , i m either going to be mark johnson or john markson .
really ?
!
okay .
thanks .
you want to hug it out ?
yay !
okay !
bye , pheebs !
ha !
ha !
ha !
or 'you are such a nice guy ' means 'I am going to be dating leather wearing alcoholics and complaining about them to you ' .
yeah , it is like when you are a kid , and your parents put your dog to sleep , and they tell you it went off to live on some farm .
so how does it feel knowing you are about to die ?
hey , that was really good !
okay .
so .
whaddya want from me , damone , huh ?
smoke away .
i think this is probably why damone smokes in his cell alone .
relax your hand !
not so much !
hey !
alright , now try taking a puff .
alright .
.
okay .
no .
give it to me .
it is fine , it is fine .
look , do you want to get this part , or not ?
here .
do not think of it as a cigarette .
think of it as the thing that is been missing from your hand .
when you are holding it , you feel right .
you feel complete .
nah , not so much .
alright , now we smoke .
oh .
.
my .
.
god .
oh , satan's minions at work again .
.
.
I am smoking .
I am smoking , I am smoking .
and this   is my reward !
okay , so this time i will not quit !
all right !
I am putting it out , I am putting it out .
what are you talking about ?
we love schhteve !
schhteve was schhexy !
.
.
sorry .
oh , yeah .
I would marry him just for his david hasselhof impression alone .
you know I am going to be doing that at parties , right ?
yep , we sure showed those hassidic jewellers a thing or two about softball .
.
i personally could have a gallon of alan .
well , maybe it is a contest , y'know ?
like , collect all five ?
hey , this is so unfair !
so i have a flaw !
big deal !
like joey's constant knuckle cracking is not annoying ?
and ross , with his over pronouncing every single word ?
and monica , with that snort when she laughs ?
i mean , what the hell is that thing ?
.
i accept all those flaws , why can not you accept me for this ?
hey , y'know , i have had it with you guys and your cancer and your emphysema and your heart disease .
the bottom line is , smoking is cool , and you know it .
really ?
he does ?
hey , buddy , what is up !
oh , she told you about that , huh .
well , yeah , i have one now and then .
well , yeah , now .
well , it is not that big     well , that is true , .
.
gee , y'know , no one   no one's ever put it like that before .
well , okay , thanks !
ooh , lambchop .
how old is that sock ?
if i had a sock on my hand for thirty years it would be talking too .
joey ate my last stick of gum , so i killed him .
do you think that was wrong ?
ooh , I am alive with pleasure now .
oh , she is sorry !
i feel better !
.
that is it .
I am getting cigarettes .
i do not care , i do not care !
game's over !
I am weak !
I have got to smoke !
I have got to have the smoke !
yeah , alright .
hey .
and this from the cry for help department .
are you wearing makeup ?
that is so funny , because i was thinking you look more like joey tribbiani , man slash woman .
do you know which one you are going to be ?
good luck , man .
i hope you get it .
yes , every single one of them .
i thought it was $98.50 .
I would just like to say that I am totally behind this experiment .
in fact , I would very much like to butter your head .
all right , I am nine years old .
we just finished this magnificent thanksgiving dinner .
i have   and i remember this part vividly   a mouthful of pumpkin pie , and this is the moment my parents choose to tell me they are getting divorced .
yes .
it is very difficult to appreciate a thanksgiving dinner once you have seen it in reverse .
tonight , on a very special blossom .
oh , you must stop shooping .
no , i prefer to keep a safe distance from all this merriment .
ok , we all laughed when you did it with the stuffing , but that is not funny anymore .
the most unbelievable thing has happened .
underdog has just gotten away .
no , no , the actual cartoon character .
of course the balloon .
it is all over the news .
right before he reached macy's , he broke free and was spotted flying over washington square park .
I am goin ' to the roof , who is with me ?
come on .
an 80 foot inflatable dog let loose over the city .
how often does that happen ?
do either of you have the keys ?
for an emergency just like this .
ok , monica , only dogs can hear you now , so , look , the door's open .
here we go .
now this feels like thanksgiving .
shall i carve ?
ok , who wants light cheese , and who wants dark cheese ?
I would like to propose a toast .
little toast here , ding ding .
i know this is not the kind of thanksgiving that all of you all planned , but for me , this has been really great , you know , i think because it did not involve divorce or projectile vomiting .
anyway , i was just thinking , i mean , if you would gone to vail , and if you guys'd been with your family , if you did not have syphilis and stuff , we would not be all together , you know ?
so i guess what I am trying to say is that I am very thankful that all of your thanksgivings sucked .
here , here !
okay .
oh , well thank you in advance .
hey !
!
oh that s right .
it s your first day !
so are you psyched to fight fake crime with your robot sidekick ?
are you judging them by their covers ?
because you re really not supposed to do that .
hey !
wait a minute , hold the phone !
you re not elizabeth s dad ?
!
ross !
there s a mr .
bing !
but uh ross , ross is a great guy !
i was roommates with him in college .
uh , funny story   you re roommate in college died didn t he ?
yes , we were just  hey honey , you got the kind with the little girl , you said we were going to to get the kind with the baby .
no , the little girl creeps me out .
why would the baby creep me out ?
this is going in your book ?
hey !
damn those robots , they re supposed to be our faithful servants !
so do you think uh , joey s more charming than me ?
yeah , you wish .
who ?
hmm .
oh .
oh oh .

the only way that i said six would be if the seven s , let meet at seven , not at six .
oh my good god .
what ?

but i do not want to do it in a cup !
it is weird !
in a doctor's office ?
i cannot believe ross told you that !
and in my defense , it was a wendy's !
yeah , ok .
I am sure that doctor's office can not be worst than on a class trip to the hershey's factory !
oh , yeah !
rachel talks too !
i have a weird feeling about this place .
how do i know that they are not going to secretly videotape me and put it all over the internet .

i just assumed that everything was going to be ok .
yeah , but what if it is not ?
what if there is a reason why we can not have a baby ?
oh , oh , yeah , ok , thanks .
i can not believe i did not even think of that .
i guess i was just so worried about having to .
.
.
come here and do .
.
.
'that ' .
.
.
it was a wendy's !
!
it is not okay that I am aroused by this now .

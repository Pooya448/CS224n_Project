hey !
good morning , tiger !
I am making you a nice big breakfast so you can keep up your strength for tonight .
you are going to get me good and pregnant .
I have got nowhere to go this morning .
I am unemployed !
i do not know what I am going to do with my life .
well , i just lost my erection .
i mean , what am i supposed to do with myself ?
you are supposed to find your passion in life .
you can be whatever you want to be now .
it is exciting .
but it is all so overwhelming .
i do not know where to start .
hey , wait a second .
i can help you with this .
you just need to be organized .
we can make a list of your qualifications , and categorize jobs by industry .
there could be folders and files !
hey !
this is where your hyper organized pain in the ass stuff pays off !
i know !
!
!
my erection is back !
thank you !
joey , can i have a sip of your coffee and a bite of your muffin ?
okay .
pheebs , have you ever been bitten by a hungry italian ?
I am sorry , it is just , I am a little short on cash .
if you want i could loan you some money ?
oh no , no , no .
i learned never to borrow money from friends .
no , that is why richard dreyfuss and i do not speak anymore .
oh , hey , how about this ?
want to be an extra on my show ?
you could do that ?
yeah , yeah .
the pay is pretty good and you could do it for as long as you need .
oh my god , I am going to be on tv !
okay , now .
i got to tell you , being on tv is not as glamorous and exciting as you think .
oh , really ?
no it is awesome !
hi guys .
wow !
hey , why are you all dressed up ?
rachel and i are bringing emma to ralph lauren today to introduce her to everyone .
does not she look cute ?
she sure does .
why does she have a pink bow taped to her head ?
well , because if one more person says what a cute little boy  I am going to whip them with a car antenna !
i think she is going to be the hit of the office , huh ?
she is going to be hotter than peasant blouses and a line skirts .
can i get a blue bow ?
okay , i have looked through a bunch of career guides , photocopied and highlighted key passages and put them into alphabetical folders so you can make an informed decision .
how long was i in there ?
okay .
let us start with the a's .
advertising .
wait .
advertising !
that is a great idea !
do not you want to look through the rest ?
i do not think i have to hear the rest .
advertising makes perfect sense .
sorry you had to waste all this time , though .
you call eight hours alone with my label maker wasted time ?
ooh , now i get to use my shredder !
i mean , i can write slogans .
i mean , how hard can it be , right ?
cheese .
it is milk that you chew .
crackers .
because your cheese needs a buddy .
a grape .
because who can get a water melon in your mouth ?
i got one .
socks .
because your family's feet deserve the best .
honey ?
leave it to the pros .
i actually know someone in advertising .
i grew up with this guy who is a vice president at a big agency .
maybe i can get him to meet you ?
give me the phone .
the phone .
bringing you closer to people .
who have phones .
marriage .
it is not for everybody .
that went well .
almost everybody knew that she was a girl .
yeah , after you punched that one guy who got it wrong , word spread .
I am just going to go in my office and pick up some stuff  .
who the hell are you !
?
I am the hell person whose office this is !
good one , rach .
excuse me ?
joey , look at me !
I am a nurse !
yes you are .
i think it may be time for my sponge bath .
sorry , I am just so used to hitting on the extras .
so , are you excited about your scene ?
yeah !
but I am a little shaky and nervous .
oh , relax .
do not be .
you will be fine , you will be fine .
they will probably just make you stand in the back .
okay , now .
what ?
I am sorry , I am sorry , I am sorry .
I am just a little nervous .
okay , that helps .
hey , you know what ?
do not worry , pheebs !
it usually takes me three takes too !
alright , eight .
no , no .
but let me show you what i can do .
bagels and donuts .
round food for every mood .
really ?
that is great !
it is funny .
when you said unpaid  it sounded like you said unpaid .
actually , we are trying , and i do not think monica's going to want to postpone it .
we are supposed to have sex tonight .
actually , she is probably at home naked right now .
i tend to keep talking until somebody stops me .
i can just picture her on the bed right now .
wait a minute !
what do you mean , you are taking over my job ?
a vacation ?
my idea of a vacation does not involve something sucking on my nipples until they are raw .
alright !
do not get too comfortable there , because I am back in two weeks !
and i want everything back to the way it was .
i can not say that i care too much for the way you have rearranged my office .
excuse me ?
rach we have a code brown situation .
can you please , please take care of it for me ?
alright , but you have to do one sometime .
let me just get this straight !
so i go have a baby and they send some guy in to do my job ?
that is right .
you are very cheeky for a temp .
oh yeah , what department was that ?
the jerk department ?
did they mention that I am rubber and you are glue ?
oh , hi mr .
zelner .
that is great .
so now , super gavin , when i come back where are you planning on flying off to ?
oh , wow .
super ass kissing power .
today .
no , i said today !
see , for a superhero , not so much with the listening .
hey .
hey .
so , what did he say ?
well , he can be a little rough around the edges , so I am going to replace a word he used a lot , with the word puppy .
okay , so he said : if your puppy friend does not get her puppy act together , I am going to fire her mother puppy ass .
I am sorry , i can not do this .
I am not an actor .
that is right , you are not .
you are a nurse .
you are nurse with tray .
joey .
no , no .
nurse with tray does not know joey , she does not have time for friends .
she gets in that operating room and she carries that tray to the doctor , because if she does not , people die !
who dies ?
man with eye patch !
you get in there and you do your job .
yes , doctor .
okay .
hang in there , man with eye patch , your tray is coming !
yes , i did it !
!
!
i nailed it !
!
!
yay !
what is next ?
okay , from the top , people !
listen .
sudden change of plans .
my maternity leave just ended .
they told me that if i did not come back today , they were going to fire me .
what ?
no , that is illegal .
I am going to have the labor department down her so fast they will not even .
.
.
alright , alright .
calm down norma rae .
they did not actually say that .
I am just afraid if i do not come back right now this guy's going to try to squeeze me out .
what about emma ?
we do not have a nanny .
i know .
you know , we are just going to have to figure out a plan tonight .
can you please just take care of her for today ?
absolutely .
just give me your breast and we will be on our way .
come on , i do not know what else to do .
fine , fine .
we will have fun , will not we ?
yes , we will , yes we will .
ross ?
huh ?
you are pretty .
whatever i decide to do , I am going to be starting a career from scratch .
it is going to be a while before i make a living at it .
maybe now is not the right time to be starting a family .
so you have to tell monica you do not want to have a baby right now ?
yeah .
good bye .
okay , it is baby time .
pants off bing .
did not see you there geller .
yeah , ross is here so .
.
.
yeah , and i was really hoping that i could hang out .
what do you feel like doing ?
we are going to have sex .
i do not feel like having sex .
maybe we can watch a movie or something .
let me put it this way .
we are having sex whether you are here or not .
pants off bing !
alright .
now that I am back , why do not you just fill me in on what you have been up to ?
hey , they were popular when i left !
well , i should be involved in that , so why do not you get me up to speed ?
oh , no no no no .
i see what you are doing here , alright , listen , this is my job buddy .
okay , I have had it for five years , and i know how it works , so why do not you just catch me up !
oh god .
you have totally messed with the back support of my chair .
how do you fix this ?
fine , i will .
alright , fill me in !
hey .
hey .
you have a blue tie that would go with this ?
emma spit up on mine .
oh , yeah .
but you have to give it back if i get a job .
of course , by that time in the future ties will be obsolete and we will all be wearing silver jump suits .
hi , good morning lover .
i got to say after last night , I am a little weak in the knees .
here is an idea .
you walk into a room .
take a quick scan !
sorry .
but i kind of have this feeling that we may have made a baby last night .
oh god , i have to tell you something .
you are not pregnant .
what are you talking about ?
that thing that i have to do to make a baby .
i faked it .
what !
?
you faked it ?
you know what ?
i do not need a tie .
i mean , it is better , open collar .
you know , it is more casual  joey , listen .
i can not do this , it does not make any sense .
yesterday i was a nurse , and today I am a waitress at a cafe ?
oh , sometimes we use the same extras for different parts .
it is okay .
well , it is not okay , because i gave a very memorable performance as the nurse .
and now suddenly I am the waitress ?
that is going to confuse my fans .
maybe you are a nurse , but you moonlight as a waitress .
uhuh .
because I am a single mother , supporting my two children .
nice .
wait a minute .
dr .
drake ramoray and i work at the same hospital .
would not i come over to say hi to him ?
no , no .
see , you and drake are having a fight .
about what ?
he slept with you and then never called you .
and i just wanted a new daddy for davy and becky .
yeah , well , I am very angry at him , because he slept with me and never called me back .
oh , calm down !
she means on the show !
we need some new extras around here !
yes .
emma and i came in a little early to do research on the presentation .
i actually made a few changes , but i think I am caught up on everything .
so ask me anything !
except that !
oh , hello , mr .
zelner .
we are all ready for our presentation this afternoon .
what ?
i can not do that !
i have the baby , and ross is not going to pick her up for another hour .
well , there you go .
you win , you win .
you get to do the presentation , you will knock  them dead , no one will ever remember that i worked here , and then ralph will buy his helicopter , and super gavin will just fly right along side of him !
no , i can not , i have a baby .
why would you do that ?
that is really nice .
then you are not going to like what is coming .
I am sorry , I am sorry , I am sorry .
thank you , thank you .
please do not fire my friend .
just let me talk to her .
thank you , thank you .
how about i do something for you ?
tomorrow , I will bring you a hat , cover up the bald ?
hey , listen pheebs .
i was just talking to the director , and he was thinking , maybe this time you do not hit drake , you just wait on the tables ?
i can not do that .
I am an actor .
i have a process .
you are a masseuse .
you have a table with a hole in it .
wait a minute , i see what is happening here .
you are threatened .
what ?
yeah , I am so good in this scene that I am stealing focus from you .
well , rise to the challenge tribianni because i just raised the bar .
come join me up here !
yeah , you can fire her , but i would call security , she will not go easy .
you faked it ?
you could not have faked it !
oh yes you can .
you just make the faces and the noises .
guys can fake it ?
unbelievable .
the one thing that is ours !
besides , why would you fake it when we are trying to have a baby ?
that is actually why .
look , I am starting a whole new career now , and I am not saying that i do not want to have a baby , I am just saying maybe we could wait a little while .
like a month ?
or a year ?
really , you want to wait a year ?
it could be less than a year .
i mean , you have heard my stuff .
pants .
like shorts , but longer .
it will probably be more than a year .
i really want to have a baby .
yeah , me too .
look , I will just get my old job back .
no , i want you to have a job that you love .
not statistical analysis and data reconfiguration .
i quit and you learn what i do ?
it is just , i think , there is never going to be a right time to have a baby .
i mean , now you are unemployed and in a little while you will find a new job that will keep you really busy .
there is always going to be a reason not to do this , but i think once the baby comes , forget about all those reasons .
i guess .
it is always going to be scary when we have a baby .
it is going to be really scary .
i mean , god .
when we have a baby , there is going to be so much that we are not able to control .
i mean , the apartment's going to be a mess , i will not have time to clean it .
what if the baby gets into the ribbon drawer ?
messes up all the ribbons ?
!
what if there is no room for a ribbon drawer , because the baby's stuff takes up all the space !
?
where will all the ribbons go !
?
!
should we go make a baby right now before you change your mind ?
yes , please !
oh , and i promise , i will not fake it this time .
i wish i could say the same .
I am a little shook up !
hey !
out of all of us , who do you think is going to get married next ?
probably monica and chandler .
oh my god , melissa warburton .
i don t think i have the energy for this .
melissa !
wh why don t i tell you over here ?
oh no no , no !
it s good !
it s all good !

we should really learn how to play the real way .
i like our way .

it was after the sigma chi luau and melissa and i got very drunk !

well  that s y know that s we ve been alone for the last twenty minutes we re doing okay .
besides y know what ?
i i maybe we won t be alone ,  because lately i i things have been happening between me and ross , y know ?
right before i went into labor , we we had this kiss .
y know ?
so it might be the the beginning of something .
hey janice !
who s this little guy ?
no no .
no .
okay .
man !
did you see the kid on that nose ?
uh huh .
y know what i was , i was thinking about ?

umm that kiss before we left the apartment .
that was some something huh ?
yeah .

but we we got to be careful .
we we can t let that happen again , y know ?
right .
i mean we don t want to go down that road do we ?
no !
no , of course not .
no .
that s why i brought it up .
they didn t have any sodas ?
oh my god !
i m sorry , i was talking to this nurse , completely forgot .
that s all right .
and so it begins .
is she in there ?
yeah .
she s putting her down now , that s her .
oh !
look at emma !
i just can t decide who she looks more alike , you or rachel ?
oh what are you kidding ?
she s gorgeous , it s all rachel .
i m sorry , for the last time , why aren t you two together again ?
no , i know .
i know , because you re not in that place .
which would be fine , except you totally are .
it s it s complicated okay ?
yeah that s true .
yeah , you love her .
you always have .
you have a child together .
there is no right answer .
look , we ve been together .
okay ?
and then apart , and then together , and then apart , and now we have a baby .
it s just if if we got together again and it didn t work out i could never do that to emma .
i mean she she thinking everything  oh that s now me .
what do they put something in the water in this place ?
since rachel and i we re doing really , we re doing really well right now .
i know .
i know .
i know .
i know , and if you try to make it more you might wreck it .
yeah , exactly .
right .
or you might get everything you ve wanted since you were fifteen .
hey .

what s the matter ?
nothing .
what is it ?

i ve just been thinking about how my baby and i are going to be all alone .
what are you talking about alone ?
what about ross ?
oh please , he ll be with his real family , the twins and little miss new boobs .
okay , how long was i watching that woman ?
i m just saying that y know , someday ross is going to meet somebody and he s going to have his own life .
right ?
yeah , i guess so .
i just never thought i would raise this baby all by myself .
pretty dumb huh ?
hey , listen to me , listen to me you are never ever going to be alone .
okay ?
i promise that s not going to happen .
joey .
honey what would i do without you ?
you don t have to worry about that okay ?

they re right on that chair under ross s coat .
sure .
okay .
my god .
joey .
oh my god .
okay .
okay , ross , i realise that you did not expect to walk in and see that , but .
.
let me explain , okay ?
we were not doing anything !
rach , he just saw us .
shhh .
but what you saw , that is the extent of it , okay ?
one kiss .
no , come on , that is a lie .
we also kissed in barbados .
yeah , you started it !
I have got to chill .
look , we probably should have talked to you about this before it ever happened , but .
.
we feel so terrible about this , ross .
yeah , but it did happen , so .
.
.
ross ?
ross ?
can we just close the door ?
ross , say something .
anything .
so you two are .
.
?
and have you  .
.
ed ?
no , no , no !
no , no , no !
but if i had not walked in here , would you .
.
?
probably .
no , no !
ross , this is not how we wanted you to find out about this .
you have every right to go nuts .
I am not going nuts .
do you see me go nuts ?
no , but you know what i mean .
hey , hey , hey .
.
.
if you two are happy , then I am happy for you .
I am fine !
really ?
absolutely .
I am fine !

i do not know why it is coming out all loud and squeaky , because really ,  I am fine .
I am not saying i was not a little surprised to see you guys kissing .
i mean , at first i was like .
.
but now that I have had time to absorb it ; lovin ' this .
ross .
.
it is all working out !
me  & charlie , and you two .
you know what we should do ?
calm ourselves ?
no .
we should all have dinner .
yes , we will do it tomorrow night .
I will cook !
!
look , do not you think that will be a little weird ?
weird ?
what ?
what is weird ?
the only thing weird would be if someone did not like mexican food , because I am making fajitas !
!
i do like fajitas .
god , this adoption stuff is so overwhelming .
there is inter country adoption , dependency adoption .

oh , god .
so adorable .
look at them sleeping there like angels .
well , they may be a handful , but they are so cute .
oh , god , the last time i babysat them , they did the funniest thing .
.
that is a , that is a long time .
yeah , i know , frank .
i counted them when they were coming out of my area .
what ?
oh my god , frank , are you thinking of leaving ?
because i did not have those triplets so you could just run out on them !
what ?
!
you can not separate them !
that is terrible .
which one ?
thank you so much for seeing us .
phoebe has told us such great things about you guys .
so , a lot of malfunctioning wee wees and hoo hoos in this room , huh ?
i mean , you have a lovely home .
well , we appreciate anything you can tell us .
oh my god !
thank you .
i think i just had a tiny orgasm .
that is great .
can i see the book ?
you want me to wash my hands first , do not you ?
it is .
.
it is just so pretty and white .
can i adopt you ?
hey , you must be owen .
I am chandler .
hey , i was in the scouts too .
yeah , in fact my father was a den mother .
you know how to use a compass ?
you do ?
that is fantastic !
I would love to , but i got to get back to talking to your parents .
they are telling us all about how they adopted you .
what ?
i got nothing .
the first batch of margaritas was not so great , but the second batch is gooooood .
well , maybe the next batch , we could all get some .
oh , guys , this is fun , is not it ?
you know ?
just the four of us .
just hangin ' .
dude , are you okay ?
and when are the fajitas going to be ready ?
I am fine !
hey , I am great !
I am just .
.
I am just proud of us .
there is no weirdness , no tension .
no awareness .
we make a great foursome .
we should do more stuff together .
ooh !
let us take a trip .
okay , where do you think we    we can go ?
my fajitas !
!
look , charlie , i just want you to know .
ross is just having a little trouble adjusting to the thought of joey and me .
you know , he normally does not drink like this .
fajitas !
be careful , very hot plate , very hot plate !
!
ross , you do not even have oven mitts on !
that is going to hurt tomorrow !
okay , well , this is crazy .
can not seriously be talking about me taking one of your kids , can we ?
insane .
alice would never go for it , right ?
well , just you know , for argument's sake , you know , hypothetically .
which one would you be willing to give up ?
frank jr.jr .
?
uh huh .
well , alright , that is fine .
what about leslie ?
alright , so that leaves chandler .
wow , frank .
i think we just ran out of kids .
I am sorry , frank .
i did not realise things were so bad .
you know , I will help out more .
i can    i can babysit any time you want .
you name the day , and I will be there .
well , that is not good .
but you know , i can move some stuff around , and I will be there .
you and alice just take the whole day together .
are you kidding ?
that is what sisters are for .
where are bill and colleen ?
they are in the kitchen getting something to eat .
can you believe how nice they are ?
we have to leave !
!
why ?
what did you do in the bathroom ?
i did not get to the bathroom .
i bumped into owen on the way , and he did not know he was adopted .
and there is a slight chance i may have told him .
oh my god , where is my purse ?
no , you know what ?
i can replace everything in there .
get that binder , and let us go !
but kids are so intuitive .
do not you think on some level he already knows ?
see ?
intuitive !
which technically now you should give back !
I am so sorry , but you should have a sign out there or something .
or at least whisper it to people when they come in the door .
owen does not know he is adopted , and he also thinks that santa is real .
everyone ?
i would like to make a toast to rachel and joey .
ooy .
and to love .
ah , love .
l of v e , love .
l is for life .
and what is life without love ?
oh my god , are we supposed to answer ?
of is for oh , wow !
the v is for this very surprising turn of events , which I am still fine with by the way .
e is for how extremely normal i find it .
that you two are together .
and now one day you might get married and have children of your own .
dude , are you okay ?
totally .
ross , you do not seem okay .
no !
was not it ?
and you thought it would be awkward with joey and that you never really liked rachel .
okay .
oh , that is okay , girls tend not to like me .
okay , i guess it is just flan for three !
hey , hey , that rhymed !
you know what , ross ?
i think we are going to take off too .
oh , oh .
of course .
god , I am so stupid .
you guys are a couple now .
i mean , you probably just want to be alone .
no , no , it is just that it is getting late .
.
.
hey , hey , it is fine .
it is totally fine .
we have got plenty of margaritas .
it is all good .
i do not even know what that is for .
you know what ?
i think I am going to stay here and make sure he is okay .
yeah , that is probably a good idea .
yeah .
I will see you in the morning .
uh huh .
okay .
you know what , joey , i do not think he is ever going to be okay with this .
it does not look good , does it ?
morning .
here you go .
thanks .
did you stay here all night ?
yeah .
so you took off my pants and shoes ?
no , no , no .
you actually did that when you were dancing to the chicago soundtrack .
look , ross , about , about rachel and i .
listen , you do not have to worry about that , okay ?
because nothing is going to happen .
what do you mean ?
well , she and i said from the beginning that we were not going to do anything unless you were okay with it .
and clearly .
.
hey , what are you talking about ?
I am fine !
it is okay , ross , alright ?
i totally understand .
of course you are not fine .
you are .
.
you are ross and rachel .
except we are not .
i mean , we have not been a couple in like , six years .
oh my god , is that right ?
has it been that long ?
that is what i hear , yeah .
this is crazy .
i mean , six years ?
and because of me you guys are not going to be together ?
can i ask you something ?
really , what is this thing with you and rachel ?
come on , i mean , you know me , you know .
.
.
joey .
I am crazy about her .
and she feels the same way ?
i think so .
well , then , maybe it is time we all moved on .
yeah , but , ross , i mean , you are not okay with it .
no , but i want to be .
hey , i will be .
besides , I am with charlie , right ?
oh my god , I am still with charlie , are not i ?
i mean , she did not see the dance , did she ?
no , no , no , no , that was    that was just for me .
are you sure about this ?
yeah , I am sure .
and we are okay ?
hey , phoebs hey .
uhm , we just want to give you a heads up .
bill and colleen hate us .
owen did not know he was adopted , and monica told him .
what ?
still , he had to find out sometime .
yeah , but how would you like it if someone told the triplets that you gave birth to them ?
I am going to go tell emma she was an accident .
all right , all right , all right , let us play one more time , ok ?
and remember , if i win you do not move to paris .
ok !
can not believe I am risking this again , but you are on !
all right joe , you remember the rules !
heads i win , tails you lose .
just flip !
damnit !
hey !
hey !
so we thought we would throw you little going away party around seven .
oh , that sounds good !
hey , rach , you are leaving tomorrow , should not you be packing ?
it is all done !
oh , yeah , right !
and after i took a shower this morning i just threw my towel on the floor !
oh god , it hurts to even joke about it .
i know .
.
.
honey , seriously , i did it all .
the luggage that I am taking is in the bedroom , this is emma's paris stuff , these are the boxes that I am having shipped , and that is the sandwich that i made for the plane .
.
.
ok , so you have done some good work !
what about your carry ons ?
oh , well .
everything that i need  is in here and my travel documents are on the counter organized in the order that i will be needing them .
oh my god !
i have nothing left to teach you !
where is your passport ?
it should be right next to my plane ticket .
well , it is not .
what ?
maybe i put it in here  .
oh , oh , it is not in there !
oh , no !
i must have packed it in one of these boxes !
here , let me help you .
shoot .
oh , i can not believe i did this !
oh , wow , can you believe you are like three weeks away ?
you do not mind me touching your belly , do you ?
hey !
hey erica , welcome back to town !
wow , look how big you have gotten .
right , no , i understand .
no , no , i knew  .
she brought them up !
i did not realize you were coming back so soon !
yeah , and i wanted her to get to know the doctors and get settled into the hotel .
hotel ?
why is not she staying with you guys ?
because we are moving in a couple of days and it just did not make sense .
erica , those things are not free .
in fact they have one of the highest mark ups of any consumer product .
.
.
ross !
she is giving us her baby .
she can eat you if she wants .
oh man , i can not believe you guys are leaving this place .
oh , i know .
i know .
hey , you know , you can take it if you want !
the lease is still in nana's name .
no , no .
this will always be your place .
it would be too sad .
plus , how much a month does it cost to feed joey ?
yeah , it takes two incomes .
hey , is chandler here ?
we talked about catching a movie .
oh , no .
he does not have time for that .
but if you want , you can go help him and joey pack up the guest room .
mhm ,  packing    sexy cheerleader comedy .
mhm , helpful brother    creepy loner at teen movie .
what are you guys doing ?
try it , i can not feel a thing !
we are taking a break !
from ?
jumping on the bed ?
all right , rachel's party is in a couple of hours and there is a lot to do .
now , ross , you got geller blood , you are in charge of these yahoos !
you got it !
.
all right , she is right , we got to get serious .
let us put styrofoam peanuts down his pants and kick him !
no , no , no , guys .
she is right .
we should get to work .
I will take stuff out of the closet , joey you pack  them and ross you re pack whatever joey packs .
you guys hear a ringing ?
what the hell is this ?
hey !
handcuffs !
and fur line , nice !
i did not know you guys had it in ya !
chandler , you do not have a sister so you can not understand how much this bums me out .
i did not know monica had these !
mhm , maybe she used them with another boyfriend .
maybe richard !
why would she use them with richard and not me ?
i can be kinky !
i once did a naked dance for her .
.
.
with scarves !
bumming hard , guys , bumming hard .
hey !
hey !
where is mike ?
oh , he has a gig .
i kind of like being married to a rock star , you know .
my husband has a gig .
yeah ?
yeah , where is it ?
oh , he is playing organ for a children's roller skating party .
rock on !
well , i thought this would be a great opportunity to use up all the food that i do not want to move to the new house with me !
so , enjoy : smoke oyster casserole with a breakfast cereal crust , kidney beans in their own juices , and for dessert , a questionable orange .
hey .
hey .
hey , where is rach ?
oh , she is putting emma down , she will be over in a second .
great .
now it just hit her that she is leaving and she is kind of emotional so no one say anything to set her off , ok ?
yeah .
here she is !
what did i just say ?
no , no , no .
it is ok .
I am going to be fine .
come here , I will make you a drink .
oh , man !
i can not believe she is actually leaving .
how am i going to say goodbye to rachel ?
i know , she is been such a big part of my life .
and it feels like when melrose place got cancelled .
i mean .
.
.
oh , forget it .
i miss melrose place !
yeah ?
who loses fifty seven coin tosses in a row ?
head she wins , tails i lose .
wait a minute .
.
.
yes , joe ?
i forgot to pick up my dry cleaning !
well , I have been better .
uh hmm .
you guys are going to come and visit me , right ?
yes !
you know , in six months the statute of limitations runs out and i can travel internationally again !
I am going to miss you so much .
i know .
you know what ?
uhm , i have some goodbye stuff that i wanted to say to each of you and i was going to save it until the end of the night , but come here  .
hey , what do you think they are doing in there ?
huh , if i had to guess I would say rachel is putting on the bubble wrap and phoebe is doing the punching .
oh , pheebs , i do not even know where to start .
ok well , before you do , i know we were not supposed to get you going away presents ,  but i do have something for you .
oh , oh .
.
what is this ?
it is a cotton swab with a bit of my saliva on it , so that if they perfect the cloning process while you are over there , you can use the dna to create your own pheebs !
I am going to throw this away , but thank you so much for the gesture !
chandler ?
i was just in our bedroom and i found these  on my pillow .
oh , yes .
i decided to leave these out for you in case richard stops by and you want to engage on a little light bondage and moustache play !
what are you talking about ?
these are not mine .
oh yeah , right !
good luck getting another scarf dance from me !
that would be a terrible punishment .
but , I am serious , I have never seen these before .
really ?
then what are they doing in our guestroom ?
rachel used to live in that room .
rachel .
.
.
with handcuffs !
interesting !
joey's bare ass !
.
well played .
i love you phoebe .
i love you too .
please do not .
.
.
do not turn into .
.
.
you know .
.
.
french bitch !
all right .
well , if i going to do this , I would better keep going .
ok .
ok .
monica ?
yeah ?
can you come here with me for a minute ?
sure .
are you wearing waterproof mascara ?
no .
oh , you are so screwed .
hey .
what was that all about ?
she is going to say goodbye to each of us individually .
are you kidding ?
oh my god .
.
.
yeah , i know , it is going to be even worse for you .
.
.
god .
.
.
ross , get ready to do some serious crying .
oh , man , I am not going to be able to handle this .
now i know how my students feel at the end of each year .
and why they act out by giving me such bad evaluations .
mon .
.
.
okay .
.
.
I have got to .
.
.
just say what it is I am going to say .
.
.
none of the amazing things that have happened to me in the last ten years , would have happened if it was not for you .
no one has been more like a sister to me .
.
.
i know what you mean .
you are like a sister to me too .
i would not know what I am going to do without you .
.
.
you are the best friend i ever had .
what ?
i .
.
.
i .
.
.
i .
.
.
that is so sweet .
oh no , she took down monica .
.
.
and I am the crier in the family .
oh god !
i could be next .
maybe she will not talk with me if it looks like we are deep in converstation .
oh , so that thing you said about the thing .
it really made me think about that other thing .
uh , rach ?
well it is okay .
chandler is talking to her .
i really made you think about that thing uh ?
uh , rach .
.
.
i think i have something that belongs to you .
oh , I am sure going to miss pretending to laugh at your weird jokes that i do not get .
no , no , no .
.
.
they are really yours .
we .
.
.
found them in your old room .
well , these are not mine .
maybe monica used to use them with .
.
.
do not say richard !
well , if they are not monica's and they are not yours , then whose are they ?
well , i think you are forgetting the kinkiest former resident of that room .
pheebs !
yeah !
i think these are yours .
these are not mine .
.
.
look how flimsy they are , come on !
good god !
you try to hang a guy from a waterpipe with these , they will snap like a piece of licorice .
can i talk to you alone for a minute ?
sure .
you do not really handcuff guys to waterpipes do you ?
where do you think mike really is ?
oh honey .
.
.
let me just say something .
.
.
because once we get into this , I am going to get all uncomfortable and probably make some stupid joke .
.
.
i just want to say that i .
.
.
i love you .
.
.
and , I am going to miss you .
and I am so sad that you are leaving .
oh , you know what ?
let us not say anything else .
i love you .
ooh , not so tight .
.
.
I am sorry , just give me one more chance .
okay .
oh .
.
.
oh !
I am sor .
.
.
just go .
just go .
i can not , i can not .
so , i guess you are next .
you are ready ?
i do not think so .
oh , you are definately not .
i have not cried like that in years .
you cried yesterday at the six of the clock news .
that old woman was being scammed by her mechanic .
god !
i can not believe she saved me for last .
why are they taking so long ?
i do not know .
but , god , joey seems to be handling it suprisingly well .
okay , here we go .
.
.
oh .
.
.
well .
.
.
yeah .
.
.
i think I am going to take off .
huh ?
oh , you guys .
this was an amazing night .
thank you so much .
i love you .
good night .
what ?
i do not get a goodbye ?
lucky bastard !
unbelievable .
she says goodbye to everyone but me .
well , maybe she thought that with all of your history it could be , you know , implicit .
well , it needs to be plicit .
all right , let us think about this .
i mean , there is got to be an explanation .
uh .
.
.
did you do anything to make her mad ?
no , i do not think so .
you know , maybe she was just really spent from our talk .
it was pretty intense .
yeah .
mine too .
mine was a humdinger  of kay .
.
.
i mean , do not i deserve anything ?
i mean , a few tears , a cursory hug ?
not from you !
ross , if you are this upset , you should go and talk to her .
and say what ?
you owe me a goodbye  , i mean , he is got more pride than that .
the hell i do !
i do not get a goodbye ?
what ?
everyone gets a goodbye but me ?
what have i got to do to get a goodbye , huh ?
be best friends with you ?
uh , go out with you ?
have a baby with you ?
oh wait a minute , wait a minute , i did all those things .
ross .
.
.
oh no , maybe it is me , I am just not giving you enough credit .
uh , i mean it is difficult to say goodbye to five people .
uh , goodbye , goodbye , goodbye , goodbye , good .
.
.
it is physically impossible .
you know what ?
after all we have been through , i can not believe this is how you want to leave things between us .
have a , have a good time in paris .
i hope ross is not too upset .
I am sure he is not more bummed out than i am .
tell me about it .
well , you can not say we do not know how to throw a party .
all right , i think I am going to head out .
uh , where do you think you are going ?
i thought i was going home to go to bed , but I am sensing there is something less fun for me to do here .
we are moving in a couple of days and we have got a lot of packing to do .
it would be great if you guys could pitch in .
joey and i can finish up in the guest room .
oh , yeah , yeah , good idea .
oh no !
you and phoebe are going to help me in here .
you could not be cool .
okay , we are going to start in the kitchen .
plates get put into plate protectors and stacked ten to a box .
the silverware gets bundled in rubber bands and then bubble wrapped .
got it ?
good !
now i need you to be careful and efficient .
and remember , if i am harsh with you , it is only because you are doing it wrong .
hey mon , i think i figured out whose handcuffs they are .
you did ?
how ?
well , i was cleaning out the closet and i found some pictures of them .
.
.
being used .
oh my god !
let me see .
who is that dirty old lady ?
monica's grandmother .
nana liked it rough !
come on here , have a seat .
how was your night ?
erica , are you okay ?
oh my god !
relax !
we just get her some antacids .
she does not have a stomach ache , she is in labor .
oh my god !
yeah , you got to get to the hospital .
all right , chandler get the coats .
erica let us go .
phoebe and joey , keep packing !
oh my god we are going to have a baby .
all right .
we are going to have a baby !
oh my god , we are going to have a baby !
oh god , oh god , i got to sit down , i got to sit down .
ooh !
honey , it is going to be okay .
okay , okay .
.
.
okay , i feel a little better .
oh .
.
.
yes , I am sure .
oh honey , let us go .
okay bye everyone .
chandler , wait , wait , wait .
.
.
what ?
if you get a second , find out where she got that cheeseburger .
you really think i did not say goodbye to you because i do not care ?
that is what it seemed like .
i cannot believe that after ten years , you do not know one thing about me .
fine , then why did not you say something ?
because it is too damn hard ross .
i can not even begin to explain to you how much I am going to miss you .
when i think about not seeing you every day , it makes me not want to go .
.
.
okay , so if you think that i did not say goodbye to you because you do not mean as much to me as everybody else , you are wrong .
it is because you mean more to me .
so there , all right , there is your goodbye .
.
.
oh !
rach !
what ?
you keep , you keep .
.
.
you can not .
.
.
what ?
a little more .
okay .
a little more , a little more .
a little more .
.
.
all right .
okay , all right , let us do this .
all right , ready ?
yeah .
all right , now give me your best shot .
all right , here it goes .

.
.
feels like a book .
and .
.
.
.
it is a book !
oh , it is dr .
seuss !
: that book got me through some tough times .
yes , the doctors say if they remove it , he will die .
who is this from ?
oh , that is ross's .
oh .
.
.
.
.
.
oh my god .
he remembered .
remembered what ?
it was like months ago .
we were walking by this antique store , and i saw this pin in the window , and i told him it was just like one my grandmother had when i was a little girl .
oh !
i can not believe he remembered !
well , sure , but can you play it on a plane ?
oh , it is so pretty .
this must have cost him a fortune .
i can not believe he did this .
come on , ross ?
remember back in college , when he fell in love with carol and bought her that ridiculously expensive crystal duck ?
what did you just say ?
ahem .
.
.
um .
.
.
crystal duck .
no , no , no .
.
.
.
the , um , the .
.
.
'love ' part ?
f hah .
.
.
.
flennin .
.
.
.
oh .
.
.
.
my god .
oh , no no no no no .
.
.
.
that is good , just keep rubbing your head .
that will turn back time .
i mean , this is unbelievable .
i know .
this is really , really huge .
no it is not .
it is small .
it is tiny .
it is petite .
it is wee .
nuh uh .
i do not think any of our lives are ever going to be the same ever again .
ok , is there a mute button on this woman ?
i think this is so great !
i mean , you and ross !
d did you have any idea ?
no !
none !
i mean , my first night in the city , he mentioned something about asking me out , but nothing ever happened , so i just .
.
.
: w well , what else did he say ?
i mean , does he , like , want to go out with me ?
well , given that he is desperately in love with you , he probably would not mind getting a cup of coffee or something .
ross ?
all this time ?
well , I have got to talk to him .
h he is in china !
the country .
no , no , wait .
his flight does not leave for another forty five more minutes .
what about the time difference ?
from here to the airport ?
yes !
you are never going to make it !
rachel , what are you going to say to him ?
i i i do not know .
well then maybe you should not go .
he is right , because if you are just going to , like , break his heart , that is the kind of thing that can wait .
yeah , but if it is good news , you should tell him now .
i do not know .
maybe I will know when i see him .
here , look , alright , does this help ?
noooo .
.
.
look , all i know is that i cannot wait a week until i see him .
i mean , this is just too big .
y'know , i just , I have just got to talk to him .
i .
.
.
i got to .
.
.
ok , I will see you later .
rachel , i love you !
deal with me first !
ni chou chi ma !
ross !
excuse me , pardon me , excuse me .
.
.
.
hi .
oh , no , no , i do not have one .
i just need to talk to my friend .
no , i know , but i he just went on .
he is right there , he is got the blue jacket on , i .
.
.
can i j just .
.
.
ok , alright , ok , um .
.
.
then could you please , uh .
.
.
just give him a message for me ?
please ?
this is very important .
uh .
.
.
i do not know .
heh , heh .
it was nothin ' .
uhhh .
.
y'know what ?
forget about me .
let us , uh .
.
.
let us give you another turn .
sure !
why not ?
how do you mean ?
uh , so , uh , rach , uh .
.
.
do you want to save this wrapping paper , i mean , it is only a little bit torn .
.
.
so are you going to go for it with ross or should i just throw it out ?
i do not know .
i do not know .
.
.
i thought about it all the way there , and i thought about it all the way back .
.
.
and , uh , oh , you guys , y'know , it is ross .
y'know what i mean ?
i mean , it is ross .
i do not know , i mean , this is just my initial gut feeling .
.
.
but I am thinking .
.
.
oh , I am thinking it would be really great .
oh my god , me too !
oh !
oh , we would be like friends in law !
y'know what the best part is ?
the best part is that you already know everything about him !
i mean , it is like starting on the fifteenth date !
yeah , but , y'know , it is .
.
.
it would be like starting on the fifteenth date .
another good point .
no , i mean , i mean , when you are at the fifteenth date , y'know , you are already in a very relationshippy place .
y'know , it is .
.
.
you are committed .
huh ?
well , i mean , then what happens if it does not work out ?
why is not it working out ?
i do not know .
.
.
sometimes it does not .
is he not cute enough for you ?
no !
does he not make enough money ?
no , I am just .
.
.
.
maybe there is someone else .
wha .
.
.
is there ?
is there someone else ?
no !
there is .
.
there is noone else !
then why the hell are you dumping my brother ?
!
?
hey , big .
.
.
shhhh !
.
spender .
she is still asleep .
so how did it go ?
oh , it was amazing .
you know how you always think you are great in bed ?
the fact that you would even ask that question shows how little you know me .
well , it is like , last night , i could not do the thing that usually makes me great .
so i had to do all this other stuff .
and the response i got .
.
.
man , oh man , it was like a ticker tape parade !
yes , i know , as it happens my room is very very close to the parade route .
it was amazing !
and not just for her .
.
.
uh uh .
for me , too .
it is like , all of a sudden , I am blind .
but all my other senses are heightened , y'know ?
it is like .
.
.
i was able to appreciate it on another level .
i did not know you had another level .
i know !
neither did i !
hey , great skirt !
birthday present ?
yeah .
oh , from who ?
from you .
i exchanged the blouse you got me .
well , it is the thought .
hey , does not ross's flight get in in a couple hours ?
at gate 27 b ?
uh , yeah .
uh , monica , y'know , honey , I have been thinking about it and I have decided this this whole ross thing , it is just not a good idea .
oh , why ?
because , i feel like i would not just be going out with him .
i would be going out with all of you .
oh , and there would just be all this pressure , and i do not want to .
.
.
no , no , no , no , no , no pressure , no pressure !
monica , nothing has even happened yet , and you are already so .
.
.
i am not 'so ' !
ok , i was a teensy bit weird at first , but .
.
.
I will be good .
i promise .
who is it ?
c'mon up .
behind my brother's back ?
.
.
.
is exactly the kind of crazy thing you will not be hearing from me .
seven hundred bucks !
alright , you did it !
do we have any fruit ?
man , hell of a two weeks , huh ?
y'know what , though ?
i really feel like i learned something .
really ?
so , you are going to stick with this 'it is all for her ' thing ?
what , are you crazy ?
when a blind man gets his sight back , does he walk around like this ?
i can not believe you would rather go out with him than me .
would you excuse me , please ?
I am trying to have a date here .
fine , just stop thinking about me .
can not do it , can you ?
so I am thinking about you .
so what ?
i do not get it .
what do you see in this guy , anyway ?
well .
.
.
he happens to be a very nice .
.
.
guy .
.
.
.
rachel , come on .
give us a chance .
ross , it is too hard .
no , no , no .
.
.
why , because it might get weird for everyone else ?
who cares about them .
this is about us .
look , i I have been in love with you since , like , the ninth grade .
ross , you are like my best friend .
i know .
if we broke up , and i lost you .
.
.
whoa , whoa , whoa .
what makes you think we are going to break up ?
well , have you been involved with someone where you have not broken up ?
no .
but .
.
.
it only has to happen once .
look , you and i both know we are perfect for each other , right ?
i mean .
.
.
so , the only question is .
.
.
are you attracted to me ?
i do not know .
.
.
i mean , I have never looked at you that way before .
well , start looking .
wow .
right !
you are right !
you know what ?
i forgot .
.

first marriage , wife s hidden sexuality , not my fault .
second marriage , said the wrong name at the altar , a little my fault .
third marriage , well they really shouldn t allow you to get married when you re that drunk and have writing all over your face , nevada s fault .

!
she said , he s obviously still in love with this rachel girl .
this is crazy !
i mean , yes yes rachel is my good friend and i i have loved her in the past , but now , she is just my wife !
phoebe , will you will you help me out here ?
well , i thought you loved her when you when you married her .
we were drunk !
i would ve married uh , joey with that amount of alcohol !
hey !
you could do a lot worse than joey tribbiani !
!
look , i m sorry , but you guys are wrong .
i just don t want to be divorced three times .
yes , and now he s using this three divorces reason because he wants to stay married to her because he loves her .
i must say , well done !

okay !
fine !
fine !
if if this is what you think , forget about the whole three divorce thing !
okay , i i ll go to my lawyer s office right now and get this marriage annulled !

but , i m throwing this shirt away !
i think there was a little misunderstanding before .
um hmm .
umm , when i said that uh , that chandler and i wanted to umm , live together we meant alone together .
oh my god !
oh , that s funny , i can t believe i did that .
oh no sweetie , no !
this is my fault , i wasn t clear !
i m really sorry .
and listen , you take as much time as you need to move out okay ?
there s absolutely no rush .
okay .
okay .
don t you want a cookie ?
sure ?
thanks .
maybe , do you need a tissue ?
monica , where did you get these ?
!
i made them !
ooh , good god , they re so yummy !
god , it s going to so weird like when i come home and you re not here .
y know ?
no more joey and chan s .
no more j and c s .
you want to go over to joey and chandler s ?
can t , its not there .
look , i m just going to be across the hall , we can still do all the same stuff .
yeah but we won t be able to like get up in the middle of the night and have those long talks about our feelings and the future .
not once did we do that .
hi .
hey !
hi .
so i , i told rachel it was just going to be the two of us .
oh yeah ?
well , how d she take it ?
really well .
yeah .
surprisingly well .
yeah , she didn t cry .
she wasn t angry or sad .
and you re upset because you didn t make your best friend cry ?
i mean , all i m asking for is just a little emotion !
is that too much to ask after six years ?
!
i mean what ?
are are are rachel and i not as close as you guys ?
!
i mean do we not have as much fun ?
!
don t i deserve a few tears ?
!
!
i mean we we told joey , he cried his eyes out !
hey !
i did not cry my eyes out !
!
come on !
it s like the end of an era !
no more j man and channie s !
!
okay , i got to ask , who calls us that ?
!
yes .
yes , second in two years .
third overall .
basically , rachel and i were in vegas and we got drunk  yes yes yes !
but , i i do not love her .
this was just a drunken mistake and i need to get it annulled .
i think just the annulment for today .
easy .
no problem .
ooh !
there s no way to do this without her ?
because i kind of all ready told her uh , it was , it was already taken care of .
uh ha , what about someone who looks like rachel ?
i will think about the therapy .
hey !
hey .
so um , i was thinking that maybe we should start dividing up our stuff .
okay !
y know , no point in dragging it out .
dragging out the long process of you moving out and us not living together anymore .
okay .
hey rach , what about this ?
huh ?
who who gets this ?
see , i don t know if i want it because it might be y know , too many memories !
what the hell is that ?
i don t know .
hey , rachel , you want the big plate ?
i want you to have the big plate .
wow !
mon , thanks !
i love this plate !
something to remember me by !
mon , honey you re not dying .
i m just moving out .
y know , i mean we re going to see each other all the time .
but still , it s a big change .
the end of an era , you might say !
are you okay ?
you re not blinking .
i m fine !
i just , i m thinking how much it s an end of era .
oh , all right .
but y know i got to say , i don t , i don t think six years counts as an era .
an era is defined as a significant period of time .
now , it was significant to me , maybe it wasn t significant to you !
what is the matter with you ?
!
what is the matter with you ?
!
!
why aren t you more upset ?
!
aren t you going to be sad that we re not going to be living together anymore ?
!
i mean aren t you going to miss me at all ?
!
all right , fine , but don t get mad at me .
it s it s just a little hard to believe .
what s hard to believe ?
well y know , it s you guys .
you you do this kind of stuff !
y know ?
i mean , you you were going to get married in vegas and then you backed out !
i guess i m not upset because i don t see you guys going through with it .
i m sorry .
rachel , it s going to happen .
chandler is going to move in here .
but i  no no , wait !
just let me finish , okay ?
this isn t something that we just , we just impulsively decided in in vegas , this is something we both really want .
and it is going to happen .
it is ?
really ?
yeah , sweetie .
i mean we re not , we re not going to live together anymore ?
no .
what ?
oh my god !
i m going to miss you so much !
i m going to miss you !
i mean it s the end of an era !
i know !
okay , bye !
oh no .
so ?
did you get the annulment ?
i couldn t .
i knew it !
because you love rachel .
it s not that .
okay ?
annulments are more complicated than i  yeah , complicated  because of the love .
i  i do , i do not love rachel .
i m going to tell her right now about the whole thing so we can get this marriage annulled as fast as possible .
okay ?
would i do that if i loved her ?
i ve never been more convinced of your love for her .
i do not have feelings for rachel !
okay ?
!
ohh , what s wrong ?
!
monica and chandler are really moving in here and i have to move out and everything is changing .
oh my come here !
come here !
it s okay .
everything s going to be okay .
thank you .
of course .
so , ross and rachel got married , monica and chandler almost got married , do you think you and i should hook up ?
oh we do , but not just yet .
really ?
!
well , when ?
okay umm , well , first chandler and monica will get married and be filthy rich by the way .
yeah .
but it won t work out .
wow .
i know .
then , i m going to marry chandler for the money and you ll marry rachel and have the beautiful kids .
great !
but then we ditch those two and that s when we get married .
we ll have chandler s money and rachel s kids and getting custody will be easy because of rachel s drinking problem .
oh oh , what about ross ?
i don t want to go into the whole thing , but umm , we have words and i kill him .
oh hey ross oh I am so glad someone is here could you zip me up ?
sure .

what , how do we know , we never slept with you .
and who is fault is that .
what is the big deal , you forgot , she forgot , maybe you were having an off night hey !
i never have an off night ok although sometimes when I am a little bloated i do not feel very sexy but even then I am better then most !
honey why do not you just let it go and ask her out again .
yeah your both so slutty you do not even remember who you have slept with , you are made for each other .

what !
umm .
that you had a six year long relationship with a guy named vicrum .
what !
why ?
well he seemed to bum hard that you would never been in a serious relationship .
if you had not just had a baby with my best friend i swear to lucifer a raber dog would be feasting on your danglers right now !
well phoebe , i think you will feel better when you know a little bit about vicrum , his a kite designer  and he used to date oprah .
I am not going along with some lie you made ross , no I am just going to be honest with him .
good yeah just be honest with him .
yeah I have nothing to be ashamed of ok so i have not been in a relationship that lasted longer then a month .
ok i have not had a real boyfriend you know if he can not handle that he can leave .
which he will and that is ok .
so I will just be alone forever you know alright I will be .
it will be fine .
it will be fine .
I will go walking tours with widows and lesbians .
oh  I will get it ok uh huh yeah  there is just something umm , there is something you should know  vicrum just called .
uh huh , sure , yeah .
how can you not remember me ?
how could you not remember that we slept together ?
i dunno !
come on , come on , search your brain all right .
it was  a certain amount of time ago , i was here you were here , we had sex  here , here , here not there .

my god woman !
how many people do you have to had been with not to remember any of this ?
ooooooooooh , i slept with you !
and you obviously remember me hey !
i still got it .
so were good .
I will let myself out .
.and i said vicrum you can not just call every time you get lonely you know , you , you gave up that right when you slept with rachel .
yeah well  yeah you know emma's birth certificate might say geller but her eyes say mookurgee .
i know but he call's and my heart goes to him .
you know that bastard is one smooth talking free lance kite designer .
oh .
ok i can not do this .
well there is no vicrum , ross made him up because i never really have been in a long term relationship , I have never lived with a guy , and I have never even celebrated an anniversary so .
if that is too weird for you and you want to leave i totally understand .
in fact I will close my eye's make it less awkward  you kissed me .
so you do not think I am a total freak i guess so , can i .
can i think it is cool that you kiss me and also want to kiss you again  and umm , be a little concerned about the magic markers .
this is vicrum .
hi honey I am home !
hi , how was your flight ?
oh it was great .
here why do not you sit down , get yourself comfortable because i .
have a little surprise for you .
well , well , well it must be five in tulsa because it is six of clock in ny.c !
ok  this is how much i love you .
honey why am i watching a bunch of sharks swimming around .
is this not the good part ?
do you want me to fast forward to something a little toothier .
no I am not quite sure you got the right movie that is all .
oh well this is the only one they had at our video store , but they did have something called crocodile killers .
or does it always have to be sharks ?
does what always have to be sharks .
honey look we can do something else , do you want me to get into the tub and thrash .
what is going on ?
sweetie it is ok , i still love you , let me be a part of this .
let me be a part of this !
i saw what you were doing in tulsa .
angry sharks turn you on !
no they do not  then why were you watching them and giving yourself a treat .
oh my god !
when you came in i switched the channel , i was just watching regular porn  really ?
yeah just some good old fashion girl on girl american action .
i cannot tell you how happy that makes me !
you are an amazing wife .
no really you are amazing you were actually going to do this for me , i mean where do you find the strength and understanding over something like that .
I am very , very drunk right now .
see ordinarily i would talk to her , but my confidence is shaken did i sleep with her ?
did i not sleep with her ?
you know maybe this is a wake up call , about your whole dating attitude .
your in your thirty's and you have never had a serious relationship and you have never been in a long term relationship , here you go from woman to woman , meaningless experience to meaningless experience never even worrying that it does not tern into anything serious .
your right !
i love my life !

uh , if i were omnipotent for a day , I would .
.
make myself omnipotent forever .

if i had a wish , I would wish for three more wishes .
hey , joey , what would you do if you were omnipotent ?
probably kill myself !

chandler !
i just figured out who you are !

you re lewis posin .
who ?
lewis posin !
he was my best friend in fifth grade , and and then one day i asked him to be my boyfriend and he said no .
do you know why ?
because you kept talking to him while he was trying to go to the bathroom ?
!
no !
but because he thought i was to faaaaa  .
and every time i think about it , it makes me feel as bad as i did in fifth grade !
y know , i i really think that you should apologize to julie .
what ?
are you kidding ?
that was like 16 years ago .
no , i know .
but y know what ?
it would make me feel better if lewis apologized to me .
okay , i will do it .
but i have to warn you ; this may make me a better person and that is not the man you feel in love with !
okay , all right , this is how it s going to work .
we re going to give you hypothetical maid of honor situations and you will be scored on a scale of 1 to 10 , 1 being the highest .
no , 10 is the highest .
why is 10 the highest ?
because it s the highest .
okay , rachel you re up first .
situation no .
1 : you re with monica , the wedding is about to start when monica gets cold feet .
go !
i don t want to marry chandler !
okay , uh  i ve got cold feet .
it s going to be okay !
no , one man for the rest of my life ?
i don t know if i can do it !
this means i ll never get to sleep with joey !
look monica , getting cold feet is very common .
y know , it s it s just because of all the anticipation and you just have to remember that you love chandler .
and also , i ran out on a wedding .
you don t get to keep the gifts .
very good !
drawing on your own experience , i like that !
thanks !
yes , very nice rachel .
thank you judges .
ugh , what a kiss ass .
oh !
okay , phoebe  yes !
your honor ?
we re now in the ceremony , monica is about to say , i do  when her drunk uncle starts yelling .
what do you do ?
go !
when monica was a little girl , i remember that ooh !
!
ow !
very good !
oh !
yes !
excellent !
perfect score !
wait a minute !
she just made a scene in the middle of the ceremony !
hey !
do you want do you want a little taste of pheebs ?
!
it is time for you to give your maid of honor speech .
ohh , wait a minute , we haven t pre  go !
okay !
okay !
umm , webster s dictionary defines marriage as   okay !
!
forget that !
that sucks !
!
okay , never mind !
forget it !
umm , umm , okay , uh  i met , i i met , i met monica when we were just a couple of six year olds and i became friends with chandler when he was 25 , although he seemed like a six year old .
thank you .
thank you very much .
umm , i ve known them separately and i ve known them together and and to know them as a couple is to know that you are truly in the presence of love .
so i would like to raise my glass  to monica and chandler and the beautiful adventure they are about to embark upon together .
i can think of no two people better prepared for the journey .
wow .
good speech .
yeah , it really was !
aw , thanks !
okay phoebe , i guess you re next  although i really don t see the point .
yeah .
okay , i can t believe that monica and chandler are getting married .
i remember talking about this day with rachel while we were showering together , naked .
and she s back in the game .
julie hi !
chandler bing , i , i guess you remember me .
it s a nickname , i ll explain later .
it s pretty clear .
ah , uh , i owe you a long overdue apology .
i never should have broken up with you because you were overweight .
you you you didn t know that .
well , i guess my work here is done !
all right , well first of all i would like to say that you both performed very well .
okay ?
you should be proud of yourselves .
and and i would also like to say that in this competition there are no losers .
well , except for rachel damnit !
really ?
!
i won !
what ?
!
i m sorry rach , it was , it was really close .
well then i demand a recount !
actually , it wasn t that close .
no !
y know what ?
no !
no !
you thing was so stupid anyway , this was ridiculous we re going to flip a coin !
all right ?
!
heads !
the coins have finally forgiven me !
well y know what ?
i hope monica forgives you after you throw her , her vegetarian , voodoo , goddess circley shower !
rach , it s going to be okay !
you guys are the best !
boy i tell ya , that judging stuff took a lot out of me .
yeah ?
yeah !
i was thinking about maybe going upstairs and taking a little nap on my couch .
why why would i care about that ?
no reason , i m just saying that uh  that s where i ll be .
as bad as that went i actually enjoyed myself .
i think that i m going to apologize for all of the stupid things i do .
why don t you just stop doing stupid things ?
then you wouldn t have to apologize .
i would really love it if could do both .
all right , i i have to ask .
what ?
are you going to break up with me if i get fat again ?
what ?
!
well , you broke up with julie grath !
how much weight could she have gained ?
a hundred and forty five pounds .
in one year ?
!
my god what did she eat ?
her her family !
that s not the point .
look i know it was a stupid reason to break up with somebody , but i was 15 !
well  that s not the only time this was an issue .
you remember when umm , you spent thanksgiving with us ?
you called me fat .
okay .
okay , now wait a minute that was totally different .
how ?
you were not supposed to hear that !
i said that behind you back !
what if i have babies , okay ?
i mean i m going to look different .
i m okay with that , but i m not sure that you are !
look you have to realize i don t think of you as a thin , beautiful woman .
see this is one of things that i can apologize for later !
look , what i mean is you re monica !
okay ?
and i am in love with monica .
keep going .
so you can balloon up or you can shrink down and i will still love you .
even if i shrink down to two inches tall ?
i d carry you around in my pocket .
i love you .
skidmark s still got a way with the ladies .
hi pheebs .
hi !
hi !
i just want to apologize .
i m really sorry i was a baby .
that s ridiculous rachel , we were all babies once .
oh , you mean today .
yeah .
yeah , and y know you you deserve to win .
and and y know i was thinking about it , if if you re monica s maid of honor that means i get to be yours .
oh yeah !
yeah !
oh , umm when when monica and chandler got engaged i started putting some stuff together , y know just in case  oh that s so sweet thanks .
here is a book of poetry that i know monica loves .
and and ohh god this is funny , look , this is a picture of one halloween where she dressed up as a bride .
and look , she made me carry her train , which was weird because i was wonder woman .
oh and here s a little purse that i found .
y know i just thought that maybe they could hold the rings in there .
ohh .
and umm , vintage handkerchiefs y know  because , people cry at weddings .
i m just going to grab a couple of these .
this stuff is great !
oh , i forgot this was in here .
umm , this was the uh garter that i was saving for my wedding and i wanted it to be monica s something borrowed and it s blue .
yeah  y know rach , i think that , i think you should be monica s made of honor .
you do ?
why ?
because i think it means more to you .
but pheebs , y know you earned it .
its fine .
i mean , this is something that you ve been thinking about since you were what , 14 ?
no , i was ten .
i just developed early .

yeah honey you don t believe her do you ?
i don t she said y know that i d have triplets !
but she also said one of them would be black .
just out of curiosity did she tell you how you re going to go ?

i mean i ve only got a week left , y know ?
i ve really got to start living now !
(so she picks up the latest copy of car and driver  , leans back , and starts reading . )

what s wrong with you ?
nothing !
well , i i got this blinding pain in my stomach when i was lifting weights before , then i uh passed out and uh , haven t been able to stand up since .
but um , i don t think it s anything serious .
this sounds like a hernia .
you have to you you go to the doctor !
no way !
kay look , if i have to go to the doctor for anything it s going to be for this thing sticking out of my stomach !
that s a hernia .
why did i have to start working out again ?
damn you 15s !
well , we re a little early , the lecture doesn t end for 15 minutes .
yeah , but y know we could sneak in and watch .
yeah , we could .
oh hey look !
there s some kappa kappa deltas !
i was a kappa .
hey sisters !
wow , we really are bitches .

so when rigby got his samples back from the laboratory he made a startling discovery !
what he believed to be igneous , was in fact sedimentary .
imagine his consternation when  oh bloody hell .
what the hell are you doing ?
!
look , i was nervous !
you guys had me all worried i was going to be boring !
i got up there and they were all like staring at me .
i opened my mouth and this british accent just came out .

yes , yes , bombay is bery , bery nice time of year .
hey , will you grab me a cruller ?
sit down !
will you go to the hospital ?

dude !
hernia operations cost like , a lot probably .
besides it s getting darker and more painful , that means it s healing .
i will loan you the money .
just go to the hospital and let s just get that thing pushed back in .
thank you , but it would take me forever to pay you that money back and i don t want that hanging over my head .
okay ?
besides , as soon as my insurance kicks in i can get all the free operations i want !
yeah , i m thinking i ll probably start with that laser eye surgery too .
hey !
hey .
hey !
what s going on ?
oh joey s got a really bad hernia , but that s nothing a little laser eye surgery won t fix !
look , i m telling you if i put my hand on my stomach right here  it doesn t hurt that bad .

yeah that seems fair .
we never use them .
look , i really need some help , okay ?
why ?
why did i have to speak in a british accent ?

what do i do ?
well  why don t you phase it out ?

can you believe it ?
i finally get to run my own kitchen !
ohh , you ve waited soo long .

!
you got the job ?
!
why didn t you tell me ?

but we ve only had one job .
i know , but now we have this second one and it just , it feels like it s snowballing , y know ?
yeah !
what are you saying ?
i got offered the head chef job at allesandro s .
what ?
it s okay ,  because y'know what ?
you don t really need me for the business .
you re the cook !
with out you it s just me driving up to people s houses with empty trays and asking for money !
all right .
but umm , i i i ll pay you back all the money you invested , and you can keep the van .
for what ?
i can t believe this !
i got to get out of here .
phoebe , wait a minute !
i m an assistant buyer !
!
all right , so we ll get a little coffee , and get energized , and we ll head back out .
yeah , all right .
okay .
so , we re having fun , right ?
we don t need that wizard guy .
we hit a couple of clubs , talked to some strangers , and uh , after this , we ll head down to the docks and see about that boat thing .
i m kind of beat .
actually , me too .
are you serious ?
!
thank god !
i m exhausted !
yeah , but uh , i don t want to be up too late , so uh , i ll have a decaf .
yeah , me too .
actually , can i get some hot water with a little lemon ?
i think i strained my voice screaming in there .
does it have to be so loud ?
i can t hear a word you re saying , my ears are ringing so bad .
i m just glad i brought that extra pair of socks , y know ?
i used them as mittens , i didn t want to touch a thing in that last place .
how sad are we ?
yeah , i know .
y know what ?
we re not sad , we re not sad , we re just not 21 anymore .
y know ?
i m 29 years old , damnit !
and i want to sit in a comfortable chair , and watch television and go to bed at a reasonable hour !

!
monica !

.
.
i do not believe this .
.
.
have you guys been .
.
.
shhh .
.
.
this is the listening side of the wall .
and then she told me that she and joey had broken up , and that part of the reason was that she had feelings for me .
uh huh .
.
.
right .
.
.
yeah .
.
.
and you know i wanted to ask charlie out since the day i met her .
oh , i know .
.
.
i know it is been really hard for you .
anyway , one thing lead to another , and .
.
.
oh .
.
.
before you know it , we were kissing .
i mean , how angry do you think joey is going to be ?
that is hard to say , ross .
that is hard to say .
you know , i got to go find him .
he is got to be here someplace .
you would think !
joey !
is he gone ?

have you guys been listening this entire time ?
now , what is this ?
ah , what is this ?
well , let us see , we kissed for ten minutes and now we are talking to our friends about it , so i guess this is sixth grade !
oh no .
.
.
have you thought about it how complicated this could get ?
what about ross ?
well , he is with charlie now .
yeah , but he wants to talk to you before anything really happens with her .
and as his friend , i mean , do not you think he deserves the same from you ?
you are a pain in my ass , geller !
all right , look you guys .
.
.
look , we appreciate all the advice , but this is between joey and me and i think we can handle it .
.

okay , well we will go back in there , but will you do one thing for us ?
the people that care about you ?
sure .
.
.
enunciate !

.
.
i mean , maybe we should .
.
.
hold off until we talk to ross .
yeah .
.
.

.
.

.
.

.
.
you got shellfish in your head .
you have never said that in your life , have you ?
i thought so .

.
.
what d'ya know .
.
.
it is a treat for the eyes and the ears .
whoo , whoo .
wow , it is uhm .
.
.
kind of weird that I am sitting next to charlie after we broke up .
yeah , it is almost if air barbados does not care about your social life .
look , does someone mind switching to sit with charlie ?
oh , i uh , i mean , i .
.
.
dude , i spent the whole conference with charlie .
i understand .
.
.
no , I will do it .
wish i could switch with someone .
i really do not want to sit with allen iverson over there .
uhm .
.
.
you know , once we are in the air and the captain turns off the seatbelt sign .
.
.
you feel free to roam about my cabin .
.
.
aaah .
.
.
you are not good at this .
.
.

.
.
you have a date ?
with who ?
you have .
.
.
have a girlfriend ?

okay .
.
.
this is probably none of my business , but uhm , how long do you think you are going to keep seeing her ?
oh , okay .
.
.
good .
you do that .
and then when you get home , maybe there will be a special delivery package waiting for you .
you know what , we are going to have sex .
let us just leave it there .
right , I am going to go talk to joey .
i think this is the right time .
he is always in a good mood after the flight attendant says duty free  .
ross is coming over .
i think now would be a really good time to talk to him .
i guess so .
I am just .
.
.
really nervous .
okay , well keep in mind that by the time you are done , they will probably be serving dinner .
ooh .
.
.
still nervous ?
I am going to get the lasagna .

.
.
i want you to be happy .

yeah .
.
.

.
.
i am speachless .
.
.
i mean the fact that you would put my happiness first like that .
i mean , you are an incredible friend , you know that ?
oh .
.
.
uh .
.
.
look .
.
.
before you .
.
.
no , i mean it .
you are so loyal man , and selfless , and generous .
.
.
i am those things , yeah .
you know what ?
i know chandler longer , so i always think of him as my best friend , but now .
.
.
i may have to rethink some stuff .
.
.
dude !
hey , if there is ever , anything i can do for you .
.
.
i can not think of anything .
thanks !
yeah .
so hi !
hi !
so you eh , you talked to joey ?
ah , yeah .
we had a really good talk .
oh !
that is great !
yeah !
oh , so everything's okay ?
oh , no , it is great .

he is .
.
.
he is an amazing guy .
ah .
.
.
well , obviously i think so too .
well , I am so excited about this .
really ?
excited ?
are you kidding ?
i have had some very dirty dreams about this .
.
.
excuse me !
you did not tell him , did you ?
i could not .
he was saying all these really nice things about me .
i did not want him to get mad and take  them all back .
I am on a edge on chandler .
oh god !
alright , fine .
you know what joey , forget it .
when we go back to new york , i will tell him .
thank you .
yeah , i appreciate that .
hi , mike's place .
ooh , that was fast .
yeah , you can not do that !
oh , come on mike , strap on a pair.why do not you just tell her that we got back together .
you know , women appreciate honesty .
we also appreciate gentle spanking once in a while .
just f.y.i .
her name is precious ?
is she a purebreed or did you pick her up at the pound ?
okay , oh and you know , if she gets upset , just scratch her tummy and give her a liver snout .
i .
.
.
I am phoebe .
enchant   oh , i can not wait for everyone at work to see these .
.
.
ow !
you go back to work tomorrow night , right ?
yeah !
so if you want people to see them , then by definition you are not having them taken out .
.
.
say , at the break of dawn ?
well , if i had them taken out , then i would not be able to do this .
you like that , right ?
what are you singing ?
it is bolero  from 10  .
it is ride of the valkyries  from apocalypse now  .
.
.
see , here is the thing : the corn rose were really a solution to your frizzy hair problem .
and now that we are home , we do not have that problem anymore , so if you think about it .
.
.
i hate them !
you what ?
you said you liked them .
did i ?
let us refresh .
i believe what i said was that i could see your scalp .
fine , so you do not like them .
everybody else does .
again , let us journey back .
.
.
as i recall what rachel said , was she had never notice the shape of your skull before .
and joey .
.
.
well , joey did not realise that there was anything different .
you know what ?
i do not care .
i like it like this , and I am going to keep it .
you are just jealous because your hair can not do this .
.
.
ouch !
hit yourself in the tooth ?
and the eye !
hi .
.
.
there she is .
hi emma .
oh my god , i missed you .
oh emma , i missed you so much .
hey .

that was one time , ross , and they were only like 5 milligrams .
ooh hey , emma , daddy has some presents for you okay ?

susie , I am going to be straight with you .
.
.
mike and i are back together .
.
.
and uhm .
.
.
unfortunately that effectively ends your relationship with him .
and he is very sorry about that and wishes you the best of luck in all your endeavours .
well , i do not .
.
.
nothing , there is nothing wrong with you .
damn it woman , pull yourself together !
have some pride , for the love of god .
okay , not a fan of the tough love .
but he did not really know , you know .
he was not planning on coming to barbados and proposing to me .
.
.
look , precious .
.
.
mike's not worth this .
you are an attractive , intelligent woman and let us face it , mike's kind of a wang .
i mean , he proposed to me while he was still seeing you .
.
.
he was going to break up with you on your birthday ?
and , i do not like to kiss and tell , but he cheated on you a lot this weekend .
you are welcome !
honey , you have been in there for a long time .
.
.
is everything okay ?
not really .
i have a problem .

well , i tried , but then he had a shampoo related emergency .
so i guess now it is your turn again .
no , no , no , no , no , no , no , no .
.

i think it is better if you tell him , you know .
it is easier for a woman .
that way , you know , if he gets mad , all you have to do is go .
.
.
i did not mean it .
I am so so   ooory .
yeah , because that is what we do .
alright , alright , okay , uhm .

.
.
i know , i know .
.
.
, but that is okay .
i mean , we can control ourselves , we are not animals .
no !
of course we can wait .

i don t have the money to take her to a fancy place like that .
well sorry , that s what i do on dates .

just here  and there  .
joey got meat sauce on the banister again !
yeah , swing music is so out .
phoebe , he s got to be in the room for that to work .
what are you guys talking about ?
well umm , we were just talking about the y know , the swing kings and just wondering whether y know , they were the right way to go .
yeah , i went to a wedding once where they had swing music and uh , two months later the couple got divorced .
and now i m not saying that there s any connection here y know , but they did tell me that s why they got divorced .
but i love swing music !
yeah but the swing kings ?
y know they suck so much that people actually die at their concerts they just stop living .
look all i know is when monica and i went to see them , we had fun !
and there s another reason too .
well , what is the other reason ?
i don t want to say .
well you have to because maybe it s stupid .
well it s just while monica and i were dancing to them it was the first time i knew that you were the woman i wanted to dance all my dances with .
oh crap !
so they said our table will be ready in just a few minutes .
yeah .
oh yeah it s fine .
i guess the more muscles you have the more they can spasim out of control .
kristen ?
hi !
oh i like this place .
and technically , technically i m not breaking any rules so i  hi !
hi .
it s nice to meet you .
i used to have a friend named joey .

well umm  yes .
and another time after that .
boy i m getting hungry !
hey joey , have you ever been so hungry on a date that when a girl goes to the bathroom you eat some of her food ?
yeah .
so uh ross , well now why did that first marriage breakup ?
was it because the woman was straight or she was a lesbian ?
no .
it just seems like ross is the kind of a guy that would marry a woman on the verge of being a lesbian and then push her over the edge .
wait a minute !
were you on a poster for gonorrhea ?
have you ever slept in the same bed as a monkey ?
!
hey you leave marcel out of this !

really ?
me too !
me too !
really ?
!
uh huh !
if it s a girl , phoebe , and if it s a boy , phoebo !
maybe .
but it wouldn t hurt to have a backup , you know ?
uh , rach rach , what were you thinking ?
okay !
i was thinking if it s a girl , how about sandrine ?
it s french .
huh .
that s a really pretty name for for an industrial solvent .
okay fine , what do you have ?
well , ok , it s for a boy .
well , i know it s a little out there , but darwin .
wow , oh my god , our child will be beaten to death in the schoolyard .
yeah , by sandrine .
you re just saying that because i said no to your name !
i m really , really not .
how how about you each get five vetoes ?
all right .
all right .
that sounds fair .
yeah !
i don t think you re going to need it though .
okay , check this out .
if it s a girl , rain .
veto .
why ?
rain ?
hi .
hi , my name is rain .
i have my own kiln , and my dress is made out of wheat .
i know her !
i bought homemade soap from her at a dead show !
okay , how about , for a guy , thatcher ?
ross , why do you hate our child ?
fine , you go .
okay , james .

hey .

sex on the balcony ?
no , but someone s really not going to get over that idea , are they ?
what is it ?
i drew you a bath !
honey , i don t like baths !
could you draw me a picture of us having sex on the balcony ?
please , could you just try it for me ?
come on , i used all my best stuff !
i i i lit some candles .
i put on some music .
i used bath salts , plus bubble bath !
and got you this little plastic navy ship .
so it s a boy bath !
well , this does butch it up a bit .
i swear , if you try it , you will love it !
all right , if i do this , can we at least discuss sex on the balcony ?
absolutely .
bet i know how that discussion s going to go .
all right , this isn t so bad .
i like the flower smell !
which is okay , because i ve got my boat .
so ?
oh my god .
i told you you were a bath person !
hey , when you get out , maybe i can give you a facial !
i m going to need a bigger boat .
i don t think you had an open mind about the name ruth .
i mean , come on , little ruthie geller , how how cute is that ?
oh , oh my god !
i can practically hear the mahjong tiles !
uh , no .
no , we re not .
but you have it right there in that file ?
you could tell us whether it s a boy or a girl ?
dayton or sandrine ?
phoebe or phoebo ?

it was just a momentary lapse .
momentary lapse .
don t don t you have any self control ?
okay , a couple months late on the lecture , ross .
hello ?
i m in the bathroom , can you come in here ?
i think there s something wrong .
you know what ?

the water s tepid .
the salt didn t dissolve and is now  lodged places .

eucalyptus and chamomile oh !

joey hasn t had this much trouble getting out words since we saw him in macbeth !
that was a long night .
all right , let s break this down .
what exactly did he say to you ?
okay , he was talking about rules .
uh huh .
umm , and looking at people differently .
he didn t say anything about that to me .
what did he tell you ?
he was asking all these questions about you , me , and london .
and , of course the glue that holds this all together , the rules .
okay .
so you , me and london .
looking at people differently .
maybe he wants to do what you and i did in london with someone .
but what did he mean by rules ?
wait a minute !
he stopped talking the minute phoebe came in !
because he was looking at her differently .
and phoebe is his friend , so he thinks that would be breaking the rules !
my god !
he wants to do it with phoebe in london !
you guys ?
just a minute !
that s mrs .
tribbiani !
you don t say anything .
why would i say anything ?
that two of our best friends could start the greatest love affair of their lives !
and they would have me to thank , and we could all start having babies ?
i m not going to let you say anything .
you just stay here !
oh , god !
oh , hey , monica , i brought back your iron .
oh , you had that ?
uh huh .
i thought i lost it .
i got a new one , like , a month ago .
oh , just as well , i broke this one .
what ?
nothing .
okay .
i mean , i i , i really shouldn t say .
i mean , i m really not supposed to .
fine .
it s a humdinger !
then it s really too bad that you can t tell me .
somebody likes you !
is it chandler ?
no !
well , then tell him to stop staring !
it s joey !
really ?
!
joey ?
!
you don t say .
is it something you d be interested in ?
i don t know , i don t know , i don t know .
you know , i mean , on the one hand , mother may i ?
but y know on the other hand  no .
no , i can t .
we re friends .
no , oh , no .
i don t want to risk what we have .
i guess that makes sense .
so , you think you re going to talk to him ?
sure , yeah .
i mean , it s joey .
i don t want him to get hurt .
well , i must say , i am on fire !
first chandler , now joey !
not chandler , just joey .

hey .
hey .
you know what ?
i ve been thinking about it .
i m really coming around on the name ruth .
i think i would actually consider naming our child that .
rach , i i can t tell you how how much that means to me !
ohh  wait a minute .
wait a minute .
you you hated the name ruth !
why why would you change your mind ?
unless , you know we re never going to have to use it .
you did see the folder .
you know it s a boy !
i didn t see anything !
i actually changed my mind about the name .
i don t think so !
you re just giving me ruth so you ll get to name it when it s a boy , and that s when you ll swoop in and name him heath or blaine or sequoia .
i would sequoia ?
veto .
fine .
unless   you anticipated that i would figure all this out and you know that it actually is a girl , and you really do want her to be named ruth !
well , i m not falling for that !
okay ?
ruth is off the table !
but ross , you want the name ruth !
not like this !
hey .
hey .
well , what s up ?
umm , joey , i know .

yes , and i m sorry .
i i know things worked out for chandler and monica , but that s very rare .
i know .
i know .
and this is so much more complicated than it was for those guys .
i mean , it s rachel for god sakes .

i know .
i know .
and she s not only my friend ; she s my pregnant friend !
she s my pregnant friend who s ross  ex !
yeah that s rachel .
beat me over the head with it .

i stayed up all last night and made a list of everything i don t like about her .
you want to hear it ?
yeah .
she made me switch to light mayo .
that s it !
that s all i got !
and , you know what ?
it tastes the same and my pants fit better !
joey , i just think you re getting worked up over nothing .
this is probably just a crush .
you think ?
absolutely !
y know , you get this rush of feelings , but then it goes away .
yeah , just a crush !
that s all this is !
it s a crush !
i m joey ; i don t get deep feelings .

this would be the place where you explain the hat .
oh !
yeah , look there is this play all right ?
and I am up for the part of this real cool like suave international guy .
a real clothes horse .
so i figure that everyone at the audition is going to be wearing this kind of y'know , ultra hip , high fashion stuff .
and you are going to make them all disappear .
yeah , like you could find something as sophisticated as this .
done .
joey , if you want to look good , why do not you just come down to the store ?
I will help you out .
great !
thanks , rach !

and y'know what ?
we will meet at the checkout counter .
okay now joey , y'know that since you are returning all of this stuff right after the audition you are going to have to wear underwear ?

i mean it is hard for me to be around an attractive woman and not flirt .
hmm , well you are around me all the time and you do not flirt .
you a little sad about that sweetheart ?
i have to tie my shoe , so you go ahead , I will catch up .
okay .
okay .
come on !
that is not running !
let us go !
you guys , I am telling you , when she runs , she looks like a cross between kermit the frog and the six million dollar man .
monica had such a crush on him .
yeah , she used to kiss his poster every night before she went to bed .
oh !
i used to do that too !
did you also have his album , it is not easy being green ?
aw , mon .
.
.
so , phoebe runs weird huh ?
yeah , yeah and you know what , i know she is going to want to run again , i just do not know how to get out of it , i mean , i live with her .
why do not you just be straight with her ?
tell her the truth .
yeah .
you are right , you are right .
i should just tell her the truth .
hey !
hey !
pheebs , monica tripped me , i do not think i can ever run again , ever !
why ?
why would you do that ?
i do not know .
rachel I am I am sorry that i hurt your ankles .
ankle .

ok , I am officially unpacked .
thanks for helping me man .
joe ?
well , i guess joey went home .
oh and look , there is still one box that i have to unpack .

!
oh my god !
you almost gave me a heart attack .
boy , it was so hard not to laugh , i tell ya .
hey , hey , the place looks great !
yeah , not bad right ?
you know what , monica s going to be working late , so I am going to make this place spotless .
you know what else I am going to do , know what else I am going to do ?
I am going to go downstairs , I am going to get her some flowers .
now who would not want to live with me ?
i do not !
no , i want to live with the super hot australian dancer .
yeah , now how is that going though ?
are you okay with the not flirting thing ?
yeah .
well , so far yeah .
but it is tough you know ?
i got all this built up flirting energy and i do not know how to get rid of it .
how you doin ?
ohhhh man no no no no no , it is it is uh , you just uh , uh reminded me that uh , i need to do my stretches too .
uh uh nothing .
i i i i did not want you to touch me because I am  I am all sweaty from the workout .
i better hit the shower .
oh my god !
hi !
oh yeah , uh huh , it is me .
i saw you grab your running shoes this morning and sneak out .
you lied so you could run by yourself .
no , no phoebe no , i was .
no .
you know what , i was , i was actually just checking to , see , if i could run .
and i can !
please rachel , i am not an idiot .
no , wait phoebe .
wow , couples who live together do start to look alike .
so , mondler .
uh , what uh , what  cha doin ?
what does it look like I am doing ?
i am cleaning !
did you get monica's authorization to move all of her stuff ?
authorization ?
i do not need that .
I am going to put everything back .
put it back exactly where you found it ?
yes I am going to put it back  exactly where i found it .
kay , first of all , this attitude is not helping .
she is not going to care if i put her stuff back in the same stupid place .
whoa , hello , did you just meet monica ?
she is going to recognize that i did a nice thing and and , appreciate it .
hmm  you know , actually this'll work out well .
because when you have to move back in with joey , joey's hot new roommate can come and live with me .
i see , i see , y y you are trying to freak me out .
look chandler , monica is really weird about this kind stuff all right .

if if i want something done right , i have to do it myself .
other people just wreck stuff .
i really think i might kill someone tonight .
oh come on , come on , it can not be that bad .
it is worse .
the only thing that is getting me through is knowing that I am going to be seeing you soon .
i think i may even try to get out of here early .
no !
no no no no no no .
it sounds like they really need you down there .
well , are you just hanging out with ross ?
it is , all good !
okay bye bye mon !
she is she is going to kill me .
yeah , the phone was facing the other way .
and that goes back up there .
we should start with the big stuff .
y know ?
that will be the easiest .
uh , let us start with the couch .
i got it .
yeah that that , does not look right .
what are you talking about ?
the couch is perfectly in line with the carpet .
and then i can just walk over here and casually just put my feet right up on the .
.
.
ok , ok , here is what we do , we just uh , move the couch closer to the coffee table .
whoa , whoa , but then the back of the couch will not line up with he back of the carpet .
ok well here , we will just move the coffee table closer to the couch .
whoa , whoa , whoa , but then the coffee table will not be centered in the seating area .
yes , but the coffee table does not match the .
blahebdmsdlkhdyslkd;btyds .
rooosss !
!
!
!
look , what am i going to do ?
I am not flirting but still , I am drawing her to me like    like a moth to a flame !
what the hell's going on over here ?
!
?
!
?
monica's going to kill you !
look i need your help , i have to do something to to repel this woman !
wait a minute , wait a minute , you guys repel women all the time .
hey , I have been married 3 times no no no I have seen it happen , you you get a rapport going with a woman but somehow you manage to kill it .
what is your secret ?
look , we do not repel women ok ?
that is completely untrue .
oh no , yes we do my man .
remember when we were back in college and we went to that spring dance and you walked right up to that girl you liked and you could not stop talking about the irish potato famine ?
yeah , well what about you ?
you were not you know , so hot in college either .
after everything he said , he would go ba dum bum chessh  yeah , monica does not like that either , maybe i should stop doing that .
oh y'know what , girls do not like it when i start talking about science .
that is not specific to girls .
this is great , this is great , what else , what else ?
uh , they do not like it when you correct their grammar .
and they do not like it when you explain why your jokes are funny .
they do not like it when you keep asking them if they like you .
man , I am so lucky i have monica .
I am never going to find love again .
hey phoebe , can i talk to you for a second ?
sure okay , um , i .
.
.
all right phoebe look , i just wanted to say that I am sorry .
ok ?
i handled the situation horribly and i should not have lied to you .
so , what should you have done ?
well , i i should have told you the truth .
uh huh , which is .
.
.
?
well , y'know , the reason i did not want to go running with you is because um , well y'know the way that you run is a little .
.
.
so ?
well , it is embarrassing .
people were looking at us like we were crazy .
why do you care ?
because they are people .
but people that you do not know and will never see again .
yes , but still .
they are people with eyes .
well , i did not get embarrassed running next to miss  .
but no , okay .
no , no , i can see why running with me would be embarrassing to you .
yeah , okay .
you are uptight .
i i am not uptight hey hey hey oh oh !
listen , i am not uptight , man .
that is okay rachel .
I am not judging you ; that is just who you are .
me .
I am more free y'know ?
i run like i did when i was a kid , because that is the only way it is fun .
y'know , i mean didn t you ever run so fast you thought your legs were going to fall off ?
y'know , like when you were like running towards the swings or running away from satan ?
the neighbor's dog .
okay , is this lamp in the same place ?
who cares ?
i repel women .
no no no no no no no no !
!
!
you can not come in here !
r r r r ross is naked .
what ?
!
what ?
!
i could not say that i was naked because she is allowed too see me naked .
why does anyone have to be naked ?
why is ross naked ?
i i had to show chandler something ?
naked ?
yeah yeah i uh , i have a uh , a guy problem .
is it the same thing that chandler had ?
look , uh , just come later , we will get everything squared away and you can come back later .
okay , listen , there is still some of chandler's medicine under the sink in the bathroom .
bye !
bye !
thank god dude , what did you have ?
look , we have no time okay ?
we must focus .
we got to get everything back into its original place .
the photo album !
there were millions of pictures of the apartment in the photo album .
we just go through it and match everything to the pictures .
that is perfect !
that is brilliant !
so really , what did ya have ?
uh , do not you mean for whom ?
pizza , heh , its not like i never had that before .
ba dum bum cheshhh .
all right , all right , let us just get this out in the open okay ?
you are hot .
I am lovable .
clearly there is a vibe going on between us .
but , we are roommates and it is a huge mistake for us to continue down this road .
no , no , no , I am telling ya .
imagine yourself living in a supermarket and you will understand okay ?
so the question is , what do we do ?
oh !
oh !
i see what happened .
it is because i was trying to repel you .
right ?
believe me , you would feel a lot different if i turned it on .
oh , i do .
how you doin ?
what ?
!
?
!
oh dear god !
hey !
hey !
oh honey , I am so sorry , you were right , this feels great !
see ?
and you do not care if people are staring , it is just for a second because then you are gone !
gone !
i mean its amazing pheebs .
i feel so free and so graceful .
hey !
look out for the horse !
sorry !
is it okay for me to come in now ?
uh huh why is everything different ?
bye !
no , i do not see anything different other than the fact that the room got so much brighter when you came into it .
well , the end table is wrong , the couch looks bizarre and do not even get me started on the refrigerator magnets .
okay look , do not .
do not be mad okay ?
but after i unpacked the boxes i wanted to do something nice for you , so , i i i cleaned the apartment .
so i moved everything around and then i forgot where it , where it went back and I am sorry , I am very sorry , I am sorry , I am sorry .
it is okay .
chandler , are you afraid of me or something ?
do you want me to be afraid of you ?
of course not .
i mean gosh , chandler what you did , it is , it is a wonderful thing and i really appreciate it .
i know i have this weird thing where i want everything to be in the perfect place , but I would never expect you to worry about that .
really ?
of course !
oh well you are the best .
you come here to me .
all right , hold on okay ?
first thing's first .
okay , now did ross sit anywhere while he was naked ?
so it said that by the year 2030 , there will be computers that can carry out the same number of functions as an actual human brain .
so theoretically we could download our thoughts and our memories into this computer .
.
.
that is so janine , you you you know what , do you know we are doing right now ?
you and i , we are interfacing .
ba dum bumb cheshhh !
wow , it s like a dirty math problem .
i m sorry the answer there would be .
none of us .
well , that s really a different question .
well , there was that one time that monica and rachel got together .
excuse me , there was no time !
okay , but let s say there was .
how might that go ?
does anybody need more coffee ?
yeah , i ll take some .
hey , there s a dog out there !
oh , that is so unfortunate .
what ?
cute naked guy is really starting to put on weight .
okay , i ll be back in just a minute .
oh , phoebe i m sorry that i left lipstick marks on the phone .
you didn t leave lipstick marks on the phone .
oh , then it must ve been you .
bye .
bye bye !
that s why i moved out .
hey , y'know while we re on that , when are you going to tell my sister that you don t live here anymore .
i think on some levels she already knows .
phoebe , she doesn t know that you sneak out every night , she doesn t know that you sneak back every morning , and she doesn t know that you ve been living with your grandmother s for a week now .
okay , well maybe not on those levels .

yeah !
okay .
chandler ?
can i see you for a second ?

i mean , just impress gary and phoebe we have to go upstairs and have sex over and over and I am saying no to this , why ?
get your coat .
hey !
who is not ?
i do not , i do not think we have meet .
i I am ross .
nevermind !
i had just moved in .
thank you !
listen umm  jen , i know this may sound a little  but uh , would you maybe want to grab a cup of coffee sometime , or  umm ?
i will give you a call .
okay !
that was amazing !
phoebe and gary are so going to hear about this at dinner .
that was amazing .
we are the hottest !
huh ?
no one is hotter than we are !
you are the best .
no , you are the best .
no , you are the best .
no , you are the best .
i am the best .
hey guys !
what 'cha been doin ' ?
hey joey !
is not that the girl that waved at you the other day ?
i do not know .
but i can see through your sheet .
yeah , yeah , that is her .
but y'know what ?
does not matter , I am never going to get to meet her anyway .
why ?
because it is impossible to find her apartment !
she lives in some like of hot girl parallel universe , or something .
what are you talking about ?
she obviously lives on the second floor , seventh apartment from the left !
no .
no .
no .
she lives on the third floor , eighth apartment from the left .
no , those first two windows ,  that is the lobby .
and y'know the other one over there , that is the stairway .
you have been counting wrong .
i did not know that !
thank you monica .
i can not believe i almost lost another girl because of counting .
so uhh , you ready ?
sure .
joey  dahhhhh !
!
no !
noooo !
!
ah , first , i i would like to say thank you for agreeing to see me again .
okay .
umm , well , first i would like to start by apologizing for kissing you and uh , for yelling at you .
now you are probably going to hire one of the people who did not ah ,  who did , who did not umm , yell at you and storm out , and i think that is a big mistake and here is why .
i made a huge fool of myself and i came back , that shows courage .
when i thought you wanted sex in exchange for this job , i said no .
that shows integrity .
and , i was not afraid to stand up for myself and that shows courage .
okay umm , now i know i already said courage , but y'know you got to have courage .
and umm , and finally when i thought you were making sexual advances in the workplace , i said no and i was not litigious .
{by the way , litigious means to want to litigate and litigate is to make a lawsuit against .
so she did not want to sue him .
do not worry , i had to look it up too . }
so there you go , you got , you got  courage , you got integrity , you got  courage again , and not litigious .
look mr  zelner !
right !
i knew that !
i really , really want this job and i think , i think i would be really good at it .
oh !
you are ?
really ?
oh thank you !
oh  oh , would it be completely inappropriate to give you a hug ?
okay , well then how about a handshake ?
oh god I am sorry !
oh god , I am sorry !
i did not mean to touch that i mean you there .
there .
uhh , okay , so thank thank you , I am going to leave now thank you very much uh huh , thank you so hey !
I will see you monday !

you better believe he is tired , after the day we had !
if you know what i mean .
you know what i mean ?
honey , the tortilla chips know what you mean .
oh yeah , it is so cool .
now i got to go , officer bing has got to , 10 100 .
that is pee pee .
phoebe , you have a , a twig in your hair .
ohh ,  umm , we kind of took a little detour on the way over here .
you did not !
we did !
we violated section 12 paragraph 7 of the criminal code !
the park huh ?
a public place .
i hear ya .
excuse me for just a second !
hi chandler .
monica !
this is the men's room !
is not it ?
yes it is .
you see I have always found the men's bathroom very sexual .
have not you ?
no .
and if i did , i do not think we would be going out .
monica , this is getting ridiculous !
come on , we can not let them win !
ugh , we have already proved that we are hot !
okay ?
so why why are you getting so obsessed about this thing ?
!
because phoebe and gary are in that can not keep their hands off each other doing it in the park phase !
so ?
i feel really sad that we are not really there anymore .
oh wow !
is that what this all have been about ?
was not it a lot more exciting when we were y'know all over each other all the time ?
yeah that was great .
that was really great !
but to tell you the truth , I am more excited about where we are right now .
really ?
yeah !
I have never been in a relationship that is lasted this long before .
y'know to get past the beginning and still be around each other all the time , i think that is pretty incredible .
and the fact that this is happening all with you , yeah i think that is pretty exciting .
that is so sweet .
i know that i was acting a little crazy but umm , i feel the same way .
yeah ?
yeah .
y'know what i just realized ?
you just freaked out about our relationship .
did not .
yes you did !
admit it !
you freaked out !
okay , i freaked out a little .
little ?
!
you freaked out big time !
okay ?
and i fixed it !
we have switched places !
i am the relationship and king and you are the crazy , irrational screw up !
and now we are back .
i cannot believe ross is buying this !
thank god !
i can not watch him anymore !
you guys ready fore the movies ?
yeah !
oh by the way , thank you for loaning us pamela and yasmine .
man !
they cannot get enough !
okay , pick a card .
okay .
all right now , memorize it .
you got it ?
oh yes .
is that your card ?
yes .
hi !
hi there !
what are you talking about ?
!
well , it is not for sure but umm , we met this guy in the park who thought ben was really cute   y'know , which he is   so umm anyhoo , he uh , he gave us his card and told us to bring him down for this commercial he is auditioning .
whoa !
this guy is like the biggest commercial casting director in town !
ben takes one lousy walk in the park and gets an audition !
!
i mean , way to go ben !
man !
I have been in that park a million times and no one offered me an audition .
i know , it is crazy !
we were just pushing ben on the swings  I am always on the swings !
what am i doing wrong ?
!
that .
okay , got to go !
wish me luck !
luck !
hey rach , now that you are working at ralph lauren , can you bring me back some of those polo shirts ?
uh well , y'know what ?
i do not think if i feel comfortable stealing on my very first day  unwilling to steal from work , interesting .
besides , if anybody's going to get free stuff , it is going to be me .
okay guys , way to wish me luck !
okay , let us discuss rachel's birthday .
i say we throw a surprise party this weekend .
whoa whoa , but her birthday is not like for another month .
yeah but if we throw her a party on her birthday , then it is not a surprise .
i think it is a great idea .
yeah , we could have a dinner party and just invite her close friends .
ross !
!
we are having a surprise party for rachel !
!
okay !
!
done .
okay , great so do you want to do it together ?
i would love to do it together !
they are going to do it together .
dude !
that is my girlfriend !
what , so i got to shut it down now ?
all right , i got to take off .
I am picking up ben then we are off to the big audition .
it is going to be weird to watch some actor pretending to be ben's dad .
yeah .
weirder than watching his two moms make out ?
whoa whoa dad ?
there is a dad in the commercial ?
yeah the dad and ben eat soup and pretend to enjoy it .
whoa , hey , maybe I will go down there with ya and see if i can get an audition to play the dad .
i mean who better to play ben's father than his godfather .
you are not his godfather .
what ?
!
are you kidding ?
!
of course i am !
okay , let us go godfather .
all right !
hey !
I am in , they are going to let me audition !
really ?
that is great !
i know !
i know !
it turns out that one of the casting ladies has actually seen me in a play , so i steered clear of her  oh yeah , yeah !
he is done tons of commercials .
I have seen him in like sugar smacks , playstation , and that one for the phone company .
in fact he was so good in that one , he actually convinced me to switch phone companies .
chandler was mad  .
yeah well , he is not going to get this one .
ben is way cuter than that kid .
i mean look at him , look at you ,  that is great .
listen , would not it be great though if i got to play ben's dad ?
joey , you look nothing like ben .
i look more like him than you do !
well umm , that one is pretty but uh , i just , i just love this fabric  sorry .
oh , what a fun office .
oh no , my dad's a doctor and he would always tell me just horror stories about ghosts and goblins who totally supported the princess's right to smoke .
and then they came back from smoking and they had made all of the decisions without me !
that does not seem fair .
i know !
it is like I am being punished for not having this disgusting , poisoning habit !
yeah , it is the best .
i mean what if this keeps happening ?
y'know , they will they will be outside smoking , making all the decisions and I will just be up in my office breathing my stupid clean air , y'know ?
and then when the day comes when kim wants to promote one of us , who do you think she is going to pick ?
me or smokey smokerson ?
rachel , you can go down there , you do not have to smoke .
just say you want to get some fresh air .
yeah , i can do that .
yeah , or you can do the easy thing and smoke .
hey !
hey !
hey rach , you want to get some coffee ?
i would love to !
oh good !
yeah , i want to go to babe .
oh good .
oh wait , i change my mind !
okay , let us talk about the party !
i have so many ideas !
yeah , me too !
oh , look at that .
all right , that is a little sketch of the cake , umm some sample menus , umm y'know what i thought we would start out with tuscan style finger food , and for music , here is an alphabetized list of all my cds !
I have highlighted the ones that would go really good with the food .
what happened to the intimate dinner party ?
oh , we are not doing that .
okay  so wow , it looks like you took care of everything .
thanks a lot , co host .
what ?
!
i did not take care of everything , there is there is plenty of things for you to do !
like what ?
cups .
cups ?
you are giving me cups ?
and ice !
cups and ice ?
ooh , i get to be in charge of cups and ice ?

yeah , i had to teach ross my bit because i actually did not get a callback .

oh well , it is kind of lonely up there , so i just thought i would come out here and get some fresh air .
oh great !
oh that is okay .
excuse me , can i , can i bum one of those ?
y'know what , actually   okay , okay , okay , what is so funny over here ?
oh , i thought you guys meant marijuana cigarettes , y'know ?
y'know what i mean , like dubbies ?
and i actually , i thought to myself , wow , those guys are crazy !
but no , i actually smoke the regular ones all , all the time .
oh , me too .
oh , me too .
oh god , this is so nerve wracking !
how how do you do this ?
well , unfortunately , i do not get many callbacks so  who knows ?
yes !
!
i knew it !
!
bye bye !
so long !
later !
oh this is great !
i might actually get to play ben's dad !
yeah !
man , this is going to be kind of weird .
yeah , it is .
no , we we are going to be like best friends , that is why it is going to be weird .
hey !
is it okay if i leave this stuff here 'til rachel's birthday party ?
ah sure .
what is in  them ?
umm , cups .
oh good , because uh we got rachel 800 gallons of water .
seriously that is a lot of cups .
yeah well , that is because monica put me in charge of cups and ice , and monica is going to rue the day that she put me in charge of cups and ice .
y'know i rued the day once did not get a whole lot else done .
okay , time to bring up the rest of the cups .
oh , hi joey !
hey pheebs !

hey !
ross good , I am uh glad you are here .
i want to talk to you about something .
what is up ?
well , I have been thinking about this whole commercial thing , y'know me going up against ben , the two of us competing , and that can not lead to anything good .

I am going to tell them that i will not audition .

okay ?
it is not your fault i suck .
i mean what kind of an actor can not even say , hmm , noodle soup .

maybe maybe you did not mess up your audition because you suck , maybe you messed up because you care more about uh , your godson .
what you do mean ?
i think , sub consciously  wait whoa whoa , you lost me .
i think on some level , you you sabotaged your own audition so that ben would get the part .
well , you are way sounds a lot better than mine .
yeah .
yeah !
it is not that I am a bad actor  no !
no , it is just ah , i care so damn much about little ben that uh , it was more important to see him succeed .
there you go .
thank you !

i actually have one of those going on with every woman in america .
hey phoebe , will you give me a hand ?

i got to make up the guest bedroom .
hey , cousin cassie is coming to stay with us a few days .

hey !
hey !
hey pheebs , can i talk to you over here for a second ?

i know you re planning my surprise bridal shower .
well okay well don t ruin it !
just play along at least !
okay .
sorry .
oh my god !
we have to throw her a shower ?
!
hey !
what did you decide to do about the movie ?
i don t know !
it s not like it s porn !
this is a serious , legitimate movie .
y know ?
and the nudity is really important to the story .
that s what you say about porn .
you re right .
maybe i shouldn t even go on the call back .
no !
no you should !
a lot of major actors do nude scenes !
i mean the chance to star in a movie ?
come on !
well that s true .
and i am only naked in one scene .
plus it sounds really great .
my character s catholic and he falls in love with this jewish girl .
who run away together and they get caught in this big rainstorm .
so we go into this barn and undress each other and hold each other .
it s really sweet and and tender .
plus , everyone s going to see your thing .
well when can we have this shower ?
she has got so much going on we we have only two options .
we have friday  well that s only two days away .
what is the other option ?
yesterday !
well if we make it yesterday , woo hoo !
we re done !
oh my god phoebe , this is impossible !
we can t do this by friday !
we have to find a place .
we have to invite people !
we have to get food !
there s just too much to do !
it s impossible !
we can t do it !
we cannot do it !
we cannot do it !
rachel , calm down !
okay .
i m sorry .
you re right , you re right .
just calm down woman !
phoebe , i already , i already did .
oh okay .
all right , then i need to calm down a little .
okay .
okay .
i think we can do this if we just get organized .
all right ?
we have two days to plan this party .
we just need to make fast decisions !
okay ?
all right , where are we going to have it ?
uh , here .
what time ?
4 of clock .
food ?
finger sandwiches and tea .
ooh great !
very monica .
and chili !
ah you went one too far .
uh , flowers or balloons ?
both !
we re paying for this y know .
neither .
okay .
umm , what should we do for the theme ?
lusts of the flesh .
what ?
i don t know .
a cowboy theme ?
hey !
hey !
y know i m i m really glad we decided not to sleep together before the wedding .
oh boy me too !
y know i was thinking if we had a a big fight and uh we broke up for a few hours  yeah ?
technically we could have sex again .
what do you think , bossy and domineering ?
!
the wedding is off , sloppy and immature !
that s me !
come on !
okay .
but wait , we can t .
my cousin cassie is in the guest room , we re supposed to have lunch .
well get rid of her , obsessive and shrill .
shrill ?
!
the wedding is back on !
hi !
nice to meet you !
so , are you ready to go ?
chandler !
i ll be right with you .
cassie needs to stay at your place .
what why ?
because purvry perverson over here can t stop staring at her .
what ?
!
chandler she s our cousin !
i was not staring at her .
okay ?
i was just listening intently .
it s called being a good conversationalist .
watch .
say something .
you were staring about eight inches south of there .
fine , she can stay at my place .
by the way , what what does cassie even look like now .
she looks exactly like aunt marilyn .
umm , so this aunt marilyn is is is is she coming to the wedding ?
wafer thin ice !
hey , i m back !
uh so , will will i be reading the same scene again ?
oh great !
y know i would ve been perfect for this part , but whatever !
y know , thanks for making a bad decision and ruining your movie !
good day !
and scene !
huh ?
wasn t that fun ?
we did a little improv there .
yeah !
okay !
so you you you you were saying ?
wow !
sure !
that s great !
yeah !
yeah sure , just long as it s handled tastefully and that barn is not too cold .
so what ?
yes !
no .
what ?
barmifsaed ?
so to get this part you can t be ?
nope .
but you are ?
yep .
but you told them you weren t ?
that s right .
wow !
wow !
and it s definitely all gone ?
there s nothing there to work with ?
what were you thinking ?
i don t know !
i really want this part !
and they tell you no matter what you get asked at an audition you say yes .
like if if they want you to ride a horse , you tell  them you can !
and just figure out how to do it later .
joey !
this is not like learning to ride a horse !
this is like learning to grow a turtleneck !
i kn i know !
i know !
okay ?
and apparently tomorrow when i go in to meet the director i have to take off my clothes so that they can see what my body looks like .
oh my god , what are you going to do ?
!
i just have to call my agent and tell her i can t do the part .
unless !
unless what ?
well , this may sound crazy , but there maybe something we could fashion .
like what ?
well i m not sure yet , but umm of the top of my head i m thinking double sided tape and some sort of luncheon meat .
hey !
i ve got a great idea for party favors for the shower .
okay , we get some uh mahogany boxes and carve everyone s names in them and inside is everyone s individual birth stone .
okay .
okay .
all right , you take care of that .
and meanwhile , the party is tomorrow and we still don t have a guest list .

hey !
hey !
what s up ?
this switch thing has been driving me crazy .
so i turned it off and checked every outlet .
now , four of them don t work .
which means , one of them has to be controlled by the switch .
so , i plugged in things in all four of the outlets that that make noise , so that way , when i turn it on i just follow the noise and find out which one it is .
i bet i stopped listening before you did .
y know , you you also could ve used uh , lamps and then followed the light .
yeah , well , i m using noise .
okay .
all right !
so , is everybody ready ?

oh dear god !
not much to tell there i m really shy .
oh great !
great !
thank you .
bye bye .
i did it !
yeah !
amazing !
amazing !
oh , i don t watch soap operas .
excuse me , i have a life , y know ?
oh , good to know .
so close !
wow !
i can t believe they didn t put it in the part where you said you didn t watch soap operas .
yeah , i called the lady about that .
i told her i was just joking .
she was pretty nice about that .
you slept with her didn t you ?
little bit , yeah .
wow !
this picture of you sure is steamy .
oh yeah , that s just a little something for my huge gay fan base .
did you just wink at me ?
hey , you re the one that loves the picture .
hey you guys !
hey !
hey , what are you doing ?
that is funny , we were doing the same thing !
yeah !
it is really crazy !
the hall , the dress , the food .
.
.
i i had no idea how expensive this stuff was !
yeah it is really pricey .
i mean , i freaked when i first heard the numbers .
so what did you two do about it ?
it was pretty simple actually , i came up with a couple of cost cutting solutions , wrote out a list and monica told me to go to hell .
there is no way around it pheebs , you just going to have to accept the fact that this is going to cost you a lot of money .
yeah , and I am responsible for just like half of that .
but really , it does seem like this money could be put to better use ?
yeah !
now , how would you feel if we gave all the wedding money to charity and we just got married at city hall ?
I have got to say you guys , that is an incredible gesture !
maybe you do that next time you get married !
no , no , no .
the next time it is going to be a hawaii at sunset .
[pause ] but maybe the time after that !
hey !
hey !
what is going on ?
our adoption social worker is coming by today so we are cleaning the apartment .
we ?
you know you do not want me to help .
you can not have it both ways !
hey , is this person who decides whether or not you .
.
.
get a baby ?
kind of .
she is coming by to interview us and see where we live .
and it has to go perfectly , because if she does not like something about us she can keep us off every adoption list in the state .
hey , maybe i should stop by !
she could be a soap opera fan !
it is very impressive when the little people know a celebrity .
little people ?
celebrity .
ok , so i think I am just about done here , unless you have any bad stuff hidden somewhere , like .
.
.
porn or cigarettes ?
what .
.
.
?
no !
chandler ?
i do not , and I am offended by the insinuation !
ok , so there is not a magazine under the couch , or a pack of cigarettes taped to the back of the toilet tank , or a filthy video in the vcr ?
I will admit to the cigarettes and the magazine , but that tape is not mine .
it is not mine !
well , i guess we will never know whose it is !
yes .
we are here to make a rather sizeable donation to the children .
well , i think you are going to appreciate it the crap out of this one  and we do not want any recognition .
this is completely anonymous .
mr .
x and phoebe buffay .
buffay is spelled b you f f a y .
sure , i so glad we did this .
it feels so good !
oh , look !
and we get these free t shirts !
mhm .
.
.
it is moist .
hi !
hi !
emma will be up in a minute !
oh , good !
oh hey ross .
.
.
listen , i heard about you and charlie .
I am really sorry .
oh , that is ok .
I am sure there are tons of other beautiful paleontologists out there .
absolutely .
there was one !
she is it !
all the rest look like they should live under a bridge !
so , uhm .
.
.
what are you going to do today ?
well , i was thinking of taking emma to the playground !
oh my god , what !
?
like i said i was thinking of taking emma to the museum of knives and fire !
ok , look , ross .
i do not want emma going to the playground .
be caaauuuse .
.
.
all right , well , if you must know .
.
.
i had a traumatic .
.
.
swing incident .
.
.
when i was little .
seriously ?
yes , i was 4 years old and i was on the swing and then all of a sudden my hair got tangled in the chain .
and to get me out my mom had to had to cut a big chunk of my hair !
and it was uneven for weeks !
and you made it through that ?
i wonder who is going to play you in the movie !
ok , fine !
you can make fun of me .
i do not want emma going there .
and i was thinking claire danes .
look , I am sorry to hear about your tragedy , ok ?
but the swings are perfectly safe , and besides emma loves them .
you know what , you should come with us and you will see !
ross , those things go like 40 miles an hour !
ok ?
when you are .
.
.
and there is that moment when you are at the top , when you just do not know if you are going to return back to earth !
space is filled with orbiting children .
look , please , just come on , you know , when you ll see the look on emma s face , i swear you won t regret it .
all right !
good , you don t want to be one of those mothers who pass on their irrational fears on their children , do you ?
irrational , huh ?
all right , well , i ll remember that the next time you freak out about a spider in your apartment !
oh , yeah , that s the same , i am sure there are thirty different species of poisonous swings !
oh my god , the adoption lady is early !
ok , ok , here we go .
ok .
here we go .
stand up straight .
big smile .
hello , is this the creepy residence ?
we re waiting for the adoption lady , but , hey , i m glad you re here .
i was cleaning this morning and i found this  .
i don t know if you want to use it , but  awe , this is so sweet of you !
but you know what ?
i won t be needing a veil , i actually won t be wearing a dress at all !
i told you !
i am not coming to a naked wedding !
no , no , no , we re not having a big reception , we took the money we were going to spend on a wedding and we donate them to the children charity .
that s crazy !
.
i am sorry .
i just can t imagine giving up my one wedding day like that !
we , you know , we re different !
we don t care about having a huge party .
this is really nice for you , but , oh , please , i put this on ?
and , ow , i look  , why , well , radiant .
all right , well , who cares , i don t need a pretty veil and a fancy dress .
that s right .
you re making a commitment and that s the same , whether you do that at the plaza or , where are you going to do it ?
city hall .
ow !
oh , that sounds nice !
i am just there for jury duty .
they really spruce that place up !
it s ok , it s ok .
i made my decision .
what i really want is a great big wedding  yay !
but you already gave all your money to charity !
well , i ll just ask for it back !
i don t think you can do that !
why not !
this is her wedding day , this is way more important than some stupid kids !
that s sweet , honey , but save something for the adoption lady .
ok , careful .
ok .
careful , watch her hair .
watch her hair !
rach , she s got like three hairs !
i know  but they re just so beautiful !
oh , my god , i just pulled one out .
i promise you she s safe !
no watch how much she loves this .
ok .
ok .
here we go !
ok , careful , ok .
oh , she s smiling !
oh my god , she does like it !
see , i told you !
awe !
oh my god !
looks , she s a little dare devil !
oh , let me push , can i push ?
oh , absolutely !
ok .
oh god .
get the camera , it s in the diaper bag .
ok !
see ?
scared of swings , i bet you feel pretty silly  ow !
it s for our wedding day !
right , now , is this guy gay or straight , because one of us going to have to start flirting .
the donation we made earlier , we k  , we w  , we want it back .
yeah .
see , that money was for a big wedding , that we thought we didn t want , but it turns out we do .
i am sorry .
i am , but this wedding is just really important to me .
hey , that s not fair !
a person s wedding is important !
and especially to me !
ok ?
i didn t have a graduation party !
and i didn t go to prom .
and i spent my sweet sixteen being chased round a tire yard by an escaped mental patient who is his own words wanted to  kill me  or whatever .
so i deserve a real celebration and i am not going to let some sweaty little man make me feel badly about it .
hi , i am monica and this is chandler .
please come in .
would you like something to drink ?
ok .
great .
i am so glad that you are here .
we re really excited about getting this process started .

oh oh , yeah yeah , i bet all the sex makes it easier !
well , yeah actually .
we will try to be more careful okay ?
it is just that , we do not want everyone to know because this is going really well , and maybe the reason it is going really well is because it is a secret .
i know it sounds really weird , but we are just so bad at relationships .
we are !
help us !
help !
all right !
but ,  you do it with me once .
joey !
did not think so .

oh yeah , then I would have someone to sit with !
okay .
yeah !

okay shhh , i have to finish .
hi .
what is wrong buddy ?
someone at work ate my sandwich !
well , what did the police say ?
my thanksgiving leftover sandwich .
i can not believe someone ate it !
ross , it is just a sandwich !
just a sandwich ?
look , i am 30 years old , I am about to be divorced twice and i just got evicted !
that sandwich was the only good thing going on in my life !
someone ate the only good thing going on in my life !
okay , look , i i have enough stuff for one more sandwich , i mean i was going to eat it myself , but   that that would be incredible .
thank you so much .
i i still can not believe someone ate it !
!
i mean , look , i left a note and everything .
knock knock .
who is there ?
ross geller's lunch .
ross geller's lunch , who ?
ross geller's lunch , please do not take me .
okay ?
I am surprised you did not go home wearing your lunch .
okay , look you want to hold onto your food ?
you got to scare people off .
i learned that living on the street .
really ?
!
so what would you say pheebs ?
stuff like uh , keep your mitts off my grub ?
say ross , when you picture phoebe living on the street , is she surrounded by the entire cast of annie ?
okay , this will keep them away from your stuff .
phoebe , you are a bad ass !
someday I will , tell you about the time i stabbed the cop .
phoebe ?
well , he stabbed me first !
!
sorry I am late , but i left late .
okay .
so pheebs , what is the book about ?
i thought you said you read it in high school .
well yeah , but then i remembered i started it and there was this pep rally and i was , i was on top of the pyramid but anyway umm , what is this book about ?
okay , umm , it is this tragic love story between cathy and heathcliff and umm , it takes place on like these really creepy mores in england .
which i think represents the wildness of heathcliff's character .
i totally get symbolism .
umm , well i would have to say that it is a , it is tragic love story .
oh oh oh , symbolism !
and uh , the the uh , wildness of the mores , which i think is is mirrored in the wildness of heathcliff's character .
you completely stole my answer !
well , honey that was pretty obvious .
well how would you know ?
!
you did not even read it !
i think that uh , yours is a question with many answers .
would you care to venture one ?
are you just repeating what I am saying ?
okay then .
yeah but why did not you just say that you did not read the book ?
!
be because i did not want him to think i was stupid !
i mean , that was really embarrassing what happened to you !
phoebe !
yeah ?
phoebe !
you are note , amazing !
not only did no one touch my sandwich , but people at work are actually afraid of me .
yeah , a guy called me mental !
mental geller , yeah , i always wanted a cool nickname like that .
yeah , the best you got in high school was wet pants geller .
that was the water fountain !
okay ?
!
anyway , people are writing reports for me , uh pushing back deadlines to meet my schedule , I am telling you , you get tough with people you can get anything you want .
hey tribbiani , give me that coffee !
now !
so you uh , still wondering ?
you are smart .
i like that .
oh no no no no , wait wait wait !

i make low budget adult films .
you guys promised you would be more careful !
i mean , come on !
the good joey name is being dragged through the mud here !
we are so sorry .
yeah .
well , I am telling everyone about you !
that is the only way to explain the underwear and the video camera that does not make me look like a pig !
no no , wait !
there is got to be a better explanation .
you can tell them you had to make an adult film for your  adult film class .
yeah , i like that .
but no no , how does that explain why rachel found my underwear at your place ?
oh i do not know .
well , get ready to come out of the non gay closet !
okay , just wait , please .
i promise we will come up with something .
just give us a little more time .
all right .
hey , but it better make me look really , really good .
oh , and another thing , the video camera ?
nice !
!
yeah , of course , donald .
what ?
!
yeah .
oh no , you you do not understand .
ugh , this is so silly .
umm , this is all because of a sandwich .
yeah .
you see my my sister makes these amazing turkey sandwiches .
her secret is , she puts a , an extra slice of gravy soaked bread in the middle ; i call it the moist maker .
anyway , i i put my sandwich in the fridge over here  what ?
you ate my sandwich ?
oh oh really ?
did you confuse it with your own turkey sandwich with a moist maker ?
do you perhaps seeing a note on top of it ?
that said it was my sandwich ?
!
what ?
you you you you  threw my sandwich away !
my sandwich ?
!
!
!
my sandwich !
!
!
!
!
!
hi !
hi !
so umm , what is this book about ?
you did not read this one either ?
!
well , i was going to , but i accidentally read something else .
what ?
vogue !
hey , so tell me about this jane eyre woman .
no !
you should have read it yourself !
come on phoebe !
don t be such a goodie goodie !
fine !
okay , all right , so jane eyre , first of all , you would think she is a woman , but she is not .
she is a cyborg .
a cyborg ?
!
is not that like a robot ?
!
yeah , this book was light years ahead of its time .
umm , rachel and i were just discussing it and she had some very interesting insights .
uh , thank you phoebe .
umm , well , what struck me most when reading jane eyre was uh , how the book was so ahead of its time .
yeah , well , feminism yes , but also the robots .
hey .
hey .
okay , so umm , since that video camera thing did not work out uh , i thought that i would give you just a little preview .
you are naked in this picture !
i know .
ross ?
hey chandler .
monica !
ross , are you okay ?
I am fine !
i saw a psychiatrist at work today .
why ?
!
on account of my rage .
which i may say , right now , is out of control .
he gave me a pill for it .
a pill ?
uh huh .
well , when the psychiatrist told me i had to take a leave of absence because i yelled at my boss i started to get worked up again , so he offered me a tranquilizer .
and i thought was a good idea so , i took it .
wait a minute , they are making you take time off work ?
and you are okay with that ?
i do not know .
it is going to be weird not having a job for a while , but i , i definitely do not care about my sandwich .
ugh , that was so embarrassing !
i can not believe you let me go on and on like that !
I am sorry .
it was just so funny when you started comparing jane eyre to robocop .
that was not funny !
well , i snapped !
okay ?
you were not taking the class seriously .
phoebe , come on !
what is the big deal ?
i thought this was going to be something we could do together !
y'know , i thought it would be fun !
well , yeah !
fun is good , but y'know i also wanted to learn .
y'know , people are always talking about what they learned in high school and i never went to high school .
ohh .
oh , so you really wanted to learn .
yeah , y'know , pheebs i just wanted to have fun .
ohh , you know who you should go with ?
i know !
i know !
i know !
oh my god !
that is monica !
!
oh no no no !
no no no no no no no !
you get away from me !
!
you sick , sick , sick , sick of !
!
what is going on ?
joey has got a secret peephole !
oh no !
no !
no !
no !
yes !
he has a naked picture of monica !
he takes naked pictures of us !
and then he eats chicken and looks at them !
look !
dude !
that is my sister !
give me that !
all right , wait !
just wait .
everybody just calm down .
okay ?
let us give our friend joey a chance to explain why he is such a big pervert !
no !
i am not a pervert !
okay ?
it is just  i just  kind of  all right , look !
look .
i think i can explain this .
thank you !
joey's a sex addict .
what ?
!
!
no I am not !
!
it is okay !
it is good !
it is good .
it is a disease !
no !
no !
i am not a sex addict !
yes you are !
that is the only way to explain all this stuff !
no it is not !
no , it is not .
because you can also explain it with the truth !
well , what is the truth ?
yeah , what is going on ?
what is going on ?
i slept with monica .
well let us .let us see what everybody thinks of that ?
oh no !
you slept with my sister ?
uh yes , but it was , we just did it once uh , in london .
this is not good for my rage .
monica , is this true ?
of course it is true !
how else would you explain all the weird stuff that is been going on ?
yes it is true .
okay , but if it only happened that one time , how come we found your underwear in our apartment the other day ?
ahh oy !
that was the underwear i was wearing that night in london .
right monica ?
i guess i wanted to keep it  as a souvenir .
my god monica !
!
are you sure joe ?
are you sure you are not just a sex addict ?
no !
if anyone's a sex addict here , it is monica !
yeah .
yeah .
she has been trying to get me back in the sack ever since london !
so that is why she gave you a naked picture of herself .
that makes sense !
and the video camera ?
uhh , monica ?
i guess i set up the video camera to try and entice joey .
but sadly i could not be enticed .
unbelievable !
i mean you really kept joey's underwear ?
!
why ?

!
I am monica .
I am disgusting .
i stalk guys and keep their underpants .
well , i think we have all learned something about who is disgusting and who is not .
eh ?
all right , now , I am going to get back to my bucket .
I am only eating the skin , so the chicken's up for grabs .
i really thought you making a good point .
i mean y'know , until you got cut off .
i do not know !
i did not come with her !
all right everybody !
everybody guess what ?
i just convinced paul to give us a test next week !
come on !
tests make us all better learners !
oh yeah !
we should have essay questions !
!
oh monica that was the best thanksgiving dinner ever !
i think you killed us .
i could not possibly eat another bite .
i need something sweet .
does anyone want to watch tv ?
monica your remote does not work .
phoebe , you have to lift it and point .
oh .
aw , forget it .
yeah , you know what we should all do ?
we should play that game where everyone says one thing that they are thankful for .
ooh ooh , i !
i am thankful for this beautiful fall we have been having .
that is very nice .
that is sweet , joey .
yeah , the other day i was at the bus stop and this lovely fall breeze came in out of nowhere and blew this chick's skirt right up .
oh !
which reminds me , I am also thankful for thongs .
i mean , it is not so much an underpant as it is a feat of engineering .
i mean , it is amazing how much they can do with so little material !
and the way they play with your mind !
is it there ?
is it not there ?
are you aware that you are still talking ?
is anyone thankful for anything else besides a thong ?
huh , i do not know what to pick .
am i more thankful for my divorce or my eviction ?
hmm .
wow !
see , and i did not think you would be able to come up with anything .
I am sorry .
it is just that this is the worse thanksgiving ever .
no no no !
i am the king of bad thanksgivings .
you can not just swoop in here with your bad marriage and take that away from me .
oh , you are not going to tell the whole story about how your parents got divorced again are you ?
oh god , no .
oh , come on !
i want to hear it !
it would not be thanksgiving without chandler bumming us out !

i mean , i did not work this hard and and and lose all this weight so that i can give my flower to someone like him !
okay , first of all , if you keep calling it that , no one's going to ever take it .
then , second of all you are not actually going to have sex with him !
you are just going to make him think that you are .
yeah .
yeah .
and when he is naked i can throw him out in the front yard and lock the door and all the neighbors will just humiliate him !
then , you will definitely get him back !
okay , so how do i make him think i want to have sex with him ?
okay , oh , here is what you do .
just act like everything around you turns you on .
what do you mean ?
well , like anything can be sexy .
like umm , oh oh , like this dishtowel !
ooh , ooh , this feels sooo good against my cheek !
and and if i feel a little hot , i can just dab myself with it .
or i can bring it down to my side and bring it through my fingers while i talk to him .
i can do that !

no , i know i don t either , but ya know what , it s their party , and it s just one night .
and we don t even have to lie ; we just won t say anything .
if it comes up again , we ll just smile .
we ll nod along .
hi aunt lisa , uncle dan oh   unbelievable !

hey hey !
i don t think the flash went off .
i ll go with you somewhere there is someone with a tranquilizer gun and a huge butterfly net looking for that man .
i have to go to the bathroom too , but i don t want him complimenting my thing .
i m so we weren t in the car !

it s just that , it s so much .
well , so what i like him !
do i make fun of the people you ve dated ?
tag , janice , mona ?
no , because friends don t do that .
but , do you want my opinion ?

i feel terrible .
i know what was wrong with mona ?
open it !
open it !
open it !
yeah baby !
no , no , it was just our parents and 1 or 2 friends .
it was a small wedding .
but it was beautiful .
i mean it was small , but kind of spectacular .
on a cliff , in barbados , at sunset , and stevie wonder sang isn t she lovely as i walked down the aisle .
yeah , stevie s an old family friend .
so would i .
you wouldn t think that annie liebawitz would forget to put film in the camera .
would you excuse us for a second ?
umm  .

this may be the only wedding i ever have .
i want it to be amazing .
okay , okay .
ooooh , ooh maybe i rode in on a harley .
okay , ross , it has to be realistic .
no , i m fine .
i m great .
i m with you .
hm huh , yeah .
no , that s not necessary .
no , actually i don t eat  okay , fine !
fine !
mmm hmmmmm  .
why don t you just try one ?
what are you doin  ?
just going over my toast .
those two will never know what hit  them .
i can t wait .
they re going to be crying so hard .
they re going to be fighting for breath .
ya know if you want to , i can just hold them down and you could  .
and my veil was lace , made by blind , belgium nuns .
well , not at first , but it was very intricate work and they said even though they lost their sight , it was all worth it .
well , i don t know about that , but some said that i looked like a floating angel .
oh yeah .
that s a great story .
well , um , actually , i i took her to the planetarium .
that s that s where we had our first date .
um , she walked in and i had the room filled with lilies , her favorite flower  shhh !
i want to hear the rest !
then , fred astaire singing the way you look tonight came on the sound system , and the lights came down .
and i got down on one knee and written across the dome in the stars were the words will you marry me ?
and the ring , was the size of my fist  !
yeah uh , phoebe !
look umm , i want to apologize about before , okay ?
we were being jerks .
parker s a nice guy and i d like to get to know him .
then you better do it now .
why ?
because i m going to kill him what what ?
you guys were right .
he s just too excited about everything .
i mean i m all for living life , but this is the geller s 35th anniversary .
okay ?
let s call a spade a spade this party stinks .
i know i m having the worst time .
there was a 15 minute line for the buffet , and when i finally got up to the plates , i slipped on a giant booger !
are you sure it wasn t an oyster ?
i guess it could ve been , i didn t really look at it .
y know , i just wiped it on chandler s coat and got the hell out of there .
he s just such a great guy i m so excited about him .
oh hey , you should be excited about him .
there s nothing wrong with him he s a good guy .
you think ?
yeah .
ya know what i think ; i think we were all just being too negative .
you re right .
you re right , he s just embracing life .
we could all stand to be a little more like parker .
you know what ?
i am like him !
i m a sunny , positive person .
actually , you have a little bit of an edge .
what s that now ?
nothing  oh look it s parker !
oooh i love it !
are you kidding ?
people acting like animals to music .
come on !
okay it s time for the toast !
umm now now , i know that ross usually gives the toast , but this year i m going to do it .
no , no it s going to be great .
really !
mom , dad , when i got married , one of the things that made me sure i could do it was the amazing example the two of you set for me .
for that and so many other things i want to say thank you .
i know i probably don t say it enough , but i love you .
when i look around this room , i m i m saddened by the thought of those who could not be here with us .
nana , my beloved grandmother who would so want to be here , but she can t because she s dead .
as is our dog chi chi .
i mean look how cute she is .
.
was .
do me a favor and pass this to my parents .
remember she s dead .
okay , her and nana , gone .
wow !
hey does anybody remember when debra winger had to say goodbye to her children in terms of endearment ?
didn t see that ?
no movie fans ?
!
you want to hear something sad ?
the other day i was watching 60 minutes these orphans in romania , who have been so neglected , they were incapable of love .
you people are made of stone !
here s to mom and dad !
whatever !
oh , no , mom , it s just monica this year .
no , of course , um  um , everybody ?
um , i i just wanted to say on behalf of my new bride , rachel  , and myself .
umm , that if if in 35 years , we re half as happy as you guys are , we ll count ourselves the luckiest people in the world .
can i get you something to drink ?
like a water and valium ?
oh thank god .
yeah ?
i know !
i know !
uh huh ?
listen why don t we just um , sit and relax ?
you know just be with each other .
quietly !
let s try something else , let s play a game .
shocking !
let s play the game of who can stay quiet the longest .
but , let s play this one first .
and remember whoever talks first loses !
oh my god !
oh my god !
wrong ?
really ?
you know the word wrong .
everything isn t perfect ?
everything isn t magical ?
everything isn t a glow with the light of a million fairies ?
they were just brake lights , parker !
you don t have to put a good spin on everything .
no !
i am a positive person .
you are like santa clause on prozac , at disneyland , getting laid !
much less happy !
so long !
don t let the best door in the world hit you in the ass on your way out !
uh huh .
and then , we could ve gone from the ceremony to the reception with you in the sidecar !
ross , it just wouldn t have been feasible .
but having a dove place the ring on your finger would ve been no problem ?
it was really fun being married to you tonight .
yeah !
and !
and , it was the easiest 400 bucks i ve ever made .
okay ross , can i uh , can i ask you something ?
yeah .
that proposal , at the planetarium  i know , i know it was stupid .
are you kidding ?
!
with the , with the lilies , and and the song , and the stars !
it was really wonderful !
did you just make that up ?
no , actually i thought about it when , when we were going out .
it s how i imagined i uh , i would ask you to marry me .
well , that would ve been very hard to say no too .
it s a good thing i didn t do it , because it sounds like it would ve been a very expensive wedding .
okay , good night goodnight even if the sidecar had a windscreen so your hair wouldn t get messed up ?
i will think about it .
that s all i m askin  okay that s it .
i give up .
at mom and dad s 40th anniversary , you re the one giving the speech .
y know i don t understand why they didn t cry .
it was a beautiful speech .
oh , come on .
hey !
all that stuff you said about true love , you were right , i mean , we did learn a lot from mom and dad !
and that picture of chi chi with her mischievous grin .
and what you said about nana .
ohh , yeah she really would ve wanted to be there .
and you know what ?
i think she was .
oh good god , ross !
how the hell do you do it ?
would you let it go ?
it is not that big a deal .
not that big a deal ?
it is amazing .
ok , you just reach in there , there is one little maneuver , and bam , a bra right out the sleeve .
all right , as far as I am concerned , there is nothing a guy can do that even comes close .
am i right ?
come on !
you guys can pee standing up .
we can ?
all right , I am tryin ' that .
ok , you know what blows my mind ?
women can see breasts any time they want .
you just look down and there they are .
how you get any work done is beyond me .
oh , ok , you know what i do not get ?
the way guys can do so many mean things , and then not even care .
multiple orgasms !
so , saturday night , the big night , date night , saturday night , sat ur day night !
no plans , huh ?
not a one .
not even , say , breaking up with janice ?
oh , right , right , shut up .
chandler , nobody likes breaking up with someone .
you just got to do it .
no , i know , but it is just so hard , you know ?
i mean , you are sitting there with her , she has no idea what is happening , and then you finally get up the courage to do it , and there is the horrible awkward moment when you have handed her the note .
why do you have to break up with her ?
be a man , just stop calling .
you know , if you want , I will do it with you .
oh , thanks , but i think she would feel like we are gangin ' up on her .
no , i mean you break up with janice and I will break up with tony .
tony ?
oh , you are breaking up with tony ?
yeah , i know , he is sweet , but it is just not fun anymore , you know ?
i do not know if it is me , or his hunger strike , or , i do not know .
does anybody want anything else ?
oh , yeah , last week you had a wonderful , nutty , chocolatey kind of a cakey pie thing .
nothing , just , just , I am fine .
what is the matter ?
why so scrunchy ?
it is my father .
he wants to give me a mercedes convertible .
that guy , he burns me up .
yeah , well , it is a mercedes if i move back home .
oh , it was horrible .
he called me young lady .
ooh , i hate when my father calls me that .
did he give you that whole you are not up to this  thing again ?
oh , yeah , yeah .
actually , i got the extended disco version , with three choruses of you will never make it on your own  .
uh huh , uh huh .
my god , angela .
wow , being dumped by you obviously agrees with her .
are you going to go over there ?
no , yeah , no , ok , but not yet .
i do not want to seem too eager .
one mississippi , two mississippi , three mississippi .
that seems pretty cool .
hey , angela .
you look good .
you do not say .
so , uh , rachel , what are you , uh , what are you doing tonight ?
oh , big glamour night .
me and monica at laundorama .
oh , you uh , you want to hear a freaky coincidence ?
guess who is doing laundry there too ?

was that not clear ?
hey , why do not , um , why do not i just join you both , here ?
do not you have a laundry room in your building ?
yes , i do have a laundry room in my building , um , but there is a .
.
.

you go out with tons of girls .
i know , but , i made a huge mistake .
i never should have broken up with her .
will you help me ?
please ?
ok , bye .
well , monica's not coming , it is just going to be me and rachel .
oh .
well , hold on camper , are you sure you have thought this thing through ?
it is laundry .
the thinking through is minimal .
it is just you and rachel , just the two of you ?
this is a date .
you are going on a date .
nuh uh .
yuh huh .
so what are you saying here ?
i should shave again , pick up some wine , what ?
well , you may want to rethink the dirty underwear .
this is basically the first time she is going to see your underwear you want it to be dirty ?
no .
oh , and uh , the fabric softener ?
ok , ok , now what is wrong with my snuggles ?
what , it says I am a sensitive , warm kind of guy , you know , like a warm , fuzzy bear .
ok , i can pick something else up on the way .
there you go .
thank you .
so what does this bob guy look like ?
is he tall ?
short ?
yep .
which ?
which what ?
you have never met bob , have you ?
no , but he is .
.

oh my god , joey , for all we know this guy could be horribly .
.
.
.
horribly attractive .
I will be shutting up now .
where are they ?
where are they ?
this is nice .
we never do anything just the two of us .
it is great .
maybe tomorrow we can rent a car and run over some puppies .
eww , i do not want to do that .
here we go .
ok , have a good break up .
hey , janice .
hey , that is not good .
can i get an espresso and a latte over here , please ?

bullwinkle socks .
that is so sweet .
that is great .
well , I am going to get another espresso .
can i get you another latte ?
that is it ?
yeah , it was really hard .
oh , yeah , that hug looked pretty brutal .
ok , you were not there .
oh , 'scuse me .
i was kind of using that machine .
but i saved it .
i put my basket on top .
what ?
what is goin ' on ?
hi , uh , nothing .
that horrible woman just took my machine .
was your basket on top ?
yeah , but , there were no suds .
so ?
well , you know , no suds , no save .
no suds ?
excuse me , hold on a second .
that is my friend's machine .
hey , hey , hey , that is not the rule and you know it .
all right , show's over .
nothing to see here .
ok , let us do laundry .
that was amazing .
i can not even send back soup .
well , that is because you are such a sweet , gentle , uh .
do you , uh , do you .
oh , hey , uh you must need detergent .
what is that ?
uberveiss .
it is new , it is german , it is extra tough .
rach , do you uh , are you going to separate those ?
oh god .
oh , am i being like a total laundry spaz ?
i mean , am i supposed to use like one machine for shirts and another machine for pants ?
rach , have you never done this before ?
well , not myself , but i know other people that have .
ok , you caught me .
I am a laundry virgin .
uh , well , do not worry , I will use the gentle cycle .
ok , um , basically you want to use one machine for all your whites , a whole nother machine for colors , and a third for your uh , your uh , delicates , and that would be your bras and your under panty things .
ok , well , what about these are white cotton panties .
would they go with whites or delicates ?
uh , that , that , that would be a judgment call .
he is so cute .
so , where did you guys grow up ?
how , how did that happen ?
oh my god .
what ?
i suddenly had the feeling that i was falling .
but I am not .
so , you and angela , huh ?
you are a lucky man .
you know what i miss the most about her ?
that cute nibbly noise when she eats .
like a happy little squirrel , or a weasel .
oh , yeah , yeah , listen for it .
yeah , but it is not going to last .
she is too much for me in bed .
sexually .
I have got to tell you , bob is terrific .
it is so great to meet a guy who is smart and funny , and has an emotional age beyond , like eight .
wow .
my brother never even told me when he lost his virginity .
ok , you can do this .
it is just like pulling off a band aid .
just do it really fast , and then the wound is exposed .
janice .
hi , janice .
ok , here we go .
i do not think we should go out anymore .
janice .
ok , i know this is going to sound really stupid , but i feel that if i can do this , you know , if i can actually do my own laundry , there is not anything i can not do .
that does not sound stupid to me .
you know , it is like the first time i had to make dinner for myself , after carol left me ?
I am sorry , that is all the time we have .
next on ross .
.
.
uh oh .
what uh oh ?
uh oh , uh oh , the laundry's done .
it is , uh , it is a song .
the laundry song that we sing .
uh oh the laundry's done , uh oh , uh oh .
ross , what is the matter ?
nothing , nothing .
lee lo , the laundry's done .
come on , show me .
all right , all right , it is just that you left a red sock in with all your whites , and now , everything's kind of pink .
oh , everything's pink .
yeah , uh , except for the red sock , which is still red .
I am sorry , please do not be upset , it could happen to anyone .
except it did not .
it happened to me .
oh , god , I am going to look like a big marshmallow peep .
what am i doing ?
what am i doing ?
my father's right .
i can not live on my own !
i can not even do laundry !
something went wrong with underdog , and they could not get his head to inflate .
so anyway , um , his head is like flopping down broadway , right , and I am just thinking .
.
.
how inappropriate this is .
um , I have got something in my eye , uh , joey , could we check it in the light , please ?
oh my god .
what ?
hello !
were we at the same table ?
it is like .
.
.
cocktails in appalachia .
come on , they are close .
close ?
she is got her tongue in his ear .
oh , like you have never gotten a little rambunctious with ross .
joey , this is sick , it is disgusting , it is , it is not really true , is it ?
well , who is to say what is true ?
i mean .
.
.
oh my god , what were you thinking ?
all right , look , I am not proud of this , ok ?
well , maybe i am a little .
oh !
ow !
I am outta here .
wait , wait , wait .
you want him , i want her .
he likes you .
really ?
yeah .
I am thinking , if we put our heads together , between the two of us , we can break them up .
I am so sorry , i can not believe i did this , but i could not stop laughing at your norman mailer story .
uh , waiter , one more plate of chicken wings over here .
here is the thing , janice .
you know , i mean , it is like we are different .
I am like the bing , bing , bing .
you are like the boom , boom ,  .
.
.
boom .
oh , my god , I am so sorry .
are you ok ?
i hit her in the eye !
i hit her in the eye !
this is the worst break up in the history of the world .
oh my god .
how many of those have you had ?
oh , i do not know , a million ?
chandler , easy , easy .

la la la la la la la .
I am fine .
all right .
I am not fine .

it is like a gift .
we should always always break up together .
oh , I would like that .
you got the clothes clean .
now that is the important part .
oh , i guess .
except everything looks like jammies now .
whoa , I am sorry .
excuse me .
we had this cart .
I am sorry , you know , maybe i was not being clear .
uh , this is our cart .
hey , hey , hey , hey , quit making up rules !
all right , listen , missy .
if you want this cart , you are going to have to take me with it !
yes !
did you see that ?
you were incredible !
brand new woman , ladies and gentlemen .
i could not have done this without you .
ok , um , uh , more clothes in the dryer ?
I am fine , I am fine .
are you sure ?
no .
oh , are you sure you are ok ?
yeah .
does it still hurt ?
yeah .
what a neat idea .
all your clothes match .
I am going to do this .
hi .

excellent .
we ripped that couple apart , and kept the pieces for ourselves .
what a beautiful story .
hey , I am fine by the way .
oh , I am sorry .
where is chandler ?
oh , he needed some time to grieve .
I am free !
I am free !
that oughta do it .
i m glad you re here , we have a couple of things to ask you about the wedding ceremony .
ohh  what s the matter ?
you okay ?
yeah , it s just y know   monica said wedding .
uh , so anyway , we thought one of you could read something during the ceremony .
oh !
i would love to read a poem .
do you think you could get through a poem ?
it ll be a short one .
okay , so ross will be doing the reading .
ohhh  okay .
yeah , i guess , i guess i could do that too .
too ?
yeah , i kind of uh , have something else planned for you guys .
do you mind telling us what it is ?
sorry , i m kind of keeping this one on the q.t .
well , whatever it is , i hope it involves winking .
hey !
so i just talked to one of the dool writers today , and  what is dool ?
days of our lives .
anyway , you re not going to believe it !
my character is coming out of his coma !
!
that s great !
and and and not only that , i m gettin  a new brain !
!
so great things are happening at work and in your personal life !
wait , what do you mean you re getting a new brain ?
oh well , they re killing off one of the characters on the show , and when she dies her brain is being transplanted into my body .
what ?
a brain transplant ?
!
yes , it s a highly controversial procedure .
it s ridiculous !
well , i think it s ridiculous that you haven t had sex in three and a half months .
it s winter , they are fewer people on the street .
who are they killing off ?
uh cecilia monroe , she plays jessica lockhart .
she s my favorite character on dool .
nice .
she is so good at throwing drinks in people s faces , i mean i don t think i ve ever seen her finish a beverage .
and the way she slaps all the time !
oh !
wouldn t you love to do it just once ?
!
don t do it .
cecilia monroe man , what a great actress .
oh , tell me about it .
and she s been on the show forever , it s going to be really hard to fill her shoes .
yeah yeah , help me out here , when you come out of the brain transplant ,  you are going to be her ?
yes , but in drake remoray s body .
why is this so hard for you to get ?
i thought you were a scientist !
rach , so , that guy there .
straight or gay ?
well , I would have to say gay .
yeah ?
why ?
well mainly because he is kissing that other guy .
oh no not that guy there .
that guy right there .
oh yeah he is too cute to be straight .
ohh knockers will help us figure it out .
all right , straight , and not subtle .
ohh , he left his cell phone .
oh , well , we can hand it to gunther and he will put it in lost and found .
or we could use it to call china .
see how those guys are doing .
what if , um , if he calls his own cell phone to find out who found it and i answer and we start talking and we fell in love .
i mean would not that be a great story ?
kind of like a fairy tale for the digital age .
yeah  that does sound great .
I am going to get the phone .
what ?
wait !
why why do you get the story ?
i do not know .
i have not been out on a date in so long .
phoebe , you had a date three days ago .
that wasn t a date !
that was , that was just friends getting together  having sex .
okay .
okay , see ?
i get the phone .
no way !
no way !
you just broke with tag a week ago .
yeah !
and until now , i didn t think i d love again .
nice try .
oh hey hey wait !
how do we fairly decide who gets the phone ?
i don t know .
well umm , maybe we could uhh   ah ha !
too slow !
!
ah ha !
too cocky !
that was a great scene !
and and and that slap looks so real !
how do you do that ?
oh anyway , i just wanted to say how wonderful i think you are .
say what ?
no .
no , i m joey tribbiani ; we did a scene together yesterday .
i i m the guy in the coma !
an an anyway i i just wanted to say that since i m getting your brain when you leave the show , i was wondering if there was any tips you can give me   i don t know .
why ?
did you hear something ?
oh uh , one of the writers .
umm  okay .
ms .
monroe   oh there you go .
no phoebe !
you cannot get the phone that way ; that s not fair !
okay look , i have an idea .
why don t we , why don t we see what kind of number he has on his speed dial , and then from that we can tell who has more in common with him .
and then whoever does gets the phone .
or , we can decide by whose ever name is closer to the word phone .
i don t think so .
fine all right , but i d bet you d be singing another tune if we were fighting over a ratchet .
all right , first name on the speed dial is mom .
ohh , i lost my mom to suicide .
okay no way , you cannot use that to get the cute guy and the last blueberry muffin .
did i use that already today ?
i m sorry .
yes okay .
well now see this isn t telling us anything .
joe .
carlos .

they re still very angry !
but y know chandler is also half swedish .
you know what the swedish people are famous for ?
sitting down and being quiet .
well yeah yeah the scottish history is so much more   you can not play bagpipes at the wedding !
!
how did you know about that ?
!
we heard you play all the way from your apartment !
were you the ones called the cops ?
!
that s not really important right now .
what is important is ; while we appreciate the gesture , we just don t feel bagpipes are appropriate for our wedding .
why not ?
because we hate them .
come on that s not fair !
i mean you haven t even heard me play !
we have heard you play .
no , you ve heard my practice .

eee !
!
eee !
!
ohh .

hi .
hey , you have got to try this cheesecake .
oh , y know I am not that much of a sweet tooth .
i wow .
my god , so creamy .
oh my god , this is the best cheesecake i have ever had .
where did you get this ?
it was at the front door .
when i got home .
somebody sent it to us .
chandler , this is not addressed to you .
this is addressed to mrs .
braverman downstairs .
thief .
i no !
i did not read the box before i opened it .
and you can not return a box after you have opened the box .
why , why not ?
because it is too delicious .
chandler , you stole this cheesecake .
that is wrong .
no no no !
it is going to be okay , because mrs .
braverman is going to send away for a free one and that way we all win !
the only losers are the big cheesecake conglomerate ,  momma s little bakery .
i feel terrible , i m a horrible , horrible , horrible person .
oh , i m sorry what ?
all right , i should get going , big day a work .
y know i m in a coma ?
today , they do this test on me and it turns out i m not brain dead .
so  ah ah ah mr .
smartie pants , it s just not my character that s not brain dead .
hey , so pheebs , we still on for tonight ?
absolutely !
i ll see you at 8:00 .
okay .
oh , what s at 8:00 ?
oh , i have dinner plans with joey .
we get together about once a month to discuss the rest of you guys .
wow , did not know that !
may i say how lovely you look today ?
duly noted .
thanks .
oh !
so for tomorrow , do you want to rent a car and drive down together or what ?
what are you talking about ?
cousin frannie s wedding , its tomorrow night .
you were invited ?
!
no .
my god , i can t believe this !
i mean i knew that mom and dad were invited , but i thought that was it !
i mean from the ages 7 to 9 frannie and i were inseparable !
well , maybe since the age of 9 , frannie s made some new friends .
well l look okay , it s probably just a mistake .
let me call aunt sheryl okay ?
maybe you are invited and the invitation just got lost in the mail .
yeah , well you call her and tell her that y know when we were kids her precious little frannie tried to undress me several times , okay ?
and if i hadn t have stopped her , there probably wouldn t even be a wedding to go too .
y know , she tried to undress me too .
i used to undress my cousin glenn .
joseph francis tribbiani are you home yet ?
!
!
umm , i think he s still out .
what s wrong ?
well , i ll tell you rachel karen green , i had plans with joey tonight and he left me this note .
pheebs , can t make it , got a date .
talk to you later .
big daddy .
big daddy ?
oh that s a nickname we were trying out .
hey , y know what nickname never caught on ?
the ross a tron !
hey !
oh !
here s joseph francis !
oh wha ho !
what are you middle naming me for ?
!
i left you a note !
so what ?
!
that doesn t give you the right to ditch me !
hey , you can cancel plans with friends if there is the possibility for sex !
phoebe he s right , that is the rule .
i don t accept this rule .
when me make plans , i expect you to show up .
okay , i can t just be a way to kill time  til you meet someone better !
y know boyfriends and girlfriends come and go , but this  is for life !
wow !
i m so sorry ; i had no idea it would bother you this much .
well , it does .
okay , can i can i make it up to you ?
huh ?
i m sorry .
how about uh , dinner tomorrow night ?
!
i ll pay for myself !
okay , you wore me down .
hey joe , while you re over there how about another beer for the ross a tron ?
the ross is that back ?
!
!
hi !
another cheesecake came !
they delivered it to the wrong address again !
so just bring it back downstairs , what s the problem ?
i can t seem to say goodbye .
are you serious ?
!
chandler , we ate an entire cheesecake two days ago and you want more ?
well i ve forgotten what it tastes like okay ?
!
it was cheesecake .
it was fine .
it had a buttery , crumbly , graham cracker crust , with a very rich yet light , cream cheese filling   wow !
my whole mouth just filled with saliva !
y know what ?
forget it !
we are just hungry !
we have not had lunch !
we are just light headed !
so let us go out and have lunch and forget about the cheesecake .
yeah and we ll drop it off downstairs so that we re not tempted .
good idea .
where do you want to go to lunch ?
momma s little bakery , chicago , illinois .
awww !
mel torme died .
joey , that paper s like a year old !
aw !
does that mean the sam goody s sale is over ?
!
hey .
hey .
hey .
so i finally heard back from aunt sheryl and apparently it wasn t a mistake .
ahh , there s there s limited seating in the hall .
limited seating ?
!
i am just one tiny person !
well yeah , but she doesn t know that .
i mean , the last time she saw you you would ve turned one of those little wedding chairs into kindling .
limited seating !
oh , that is such a lame excuse !
that s not the reason she s not inviting me !
oh what s the big deal ?
!
i wasn t even invited to the ceremony , just the reception .
and and y know what ?
if it makes you feel any better , joan and i will just make an appearance and then , and then we ll we ll leave early as a sign of protest .
joan ?
yeah , joan tedeski my date .
she s an assistant professor in the linguistics department .
tall , very beautiful , and despite what some people say , not broad backed !
wait a minute , you got ross gellar and guest ?
!
i wasn t invited and you got and guest ?
!
uh uh , excuse me , i do have to interrupt on ross s behalf .
i i think the rule applies here y know , since she has a chance to get on broad back   not broad backed !
wait a minute , y know , you re bringing me !
what ?
i can t cancel on joan !
why not ?
!
bec did you not hear me ?
!
she s an assistant professor in the linguistics department , okay ?
they re wild !
why do you want to come anyway ?
because !
she s my cousin .
i mean , we grew up together !
we re family y know ?
well that s important to me .
okay , all right , i ll take you .
i ll go call joan .
aww that s nice .
family should be there , huh ?
this is her wedding , happiest day of her life .
we ll see .
well , thank you for lunch .
what ?
wait a minute , i didn t pay , i thought you paid !
so apparently we just don t pay for food anymore .
do you see what i see ?
its still there !
mrs .
braverman must be out .
she could be out of town .
maybe she ll be gone for months .
by then , the cheesecake may have gone bad .
we don t want her to come back to bad cheesecake .
no that could kill her .
well , we don t want that .
no so we re protecting her .
but we should take it .
but we should move quick .
why ?
because i think i just heard her moving around in there .
go !
go !
go !

and it s very important .
whoa whoa , what is it ?

!
that s right !
yeah , you made me feel really guilty about goin  out with that girl !

how can you eat the cheesecake without me ?
!
oh , what are you going to do ?
!
are you going to go run tell monica ?
!
are you going to tell joey ?
!
no !
because then you will have to tell them what we did !
we are desert stealers !
we are living outside the law !
y know what ?
i don t trust you with this cake anymore !
and i got it first , and i m takin  it back !

we re going to split it !
you take half and i take half !
well that s not fair , you ve already had some !

oh , well then y know what ?
i think monica would be very interested to know that you called her cheesecake dry and mealy .
what do we use to split it ?
okay !
all right , pick a half .
okay well , this side looks bigger .
uh  there s more crust on this side .
y know ?

all right , i ll pick that one .
that s also the smaller piece .
okay , there you go .
enjoy your half my friend , but that is it .
no sharing .
no switching , and don t come crying to me if you eat your piece to fast .
oh !
!
!
!
ohhh !
okay , you got to give me some of your piece .
oh ho ho ho no !

no switching !
no sharing , and don t come crying to me !
ha ha ha !
i may just sit here and have my cake all day !

!
why on lips ?
!
here s frannie .
hmm , won t she be happy to see me ?

i didn t bring you here so you can ambush her .
frannie was the one who found your playboys and showed them to mom .
that bitch !

ross brought me .
how do you like that ?
!
hi frannie , congratulations .
you invite my brother , you invite my whole family , and not me ?
!
why ?
!
what why wouldn t you want me at your wedding ?
what could i have possibly done ?
!
stuart !
so it s really a question of who could you have possibly done .
are you sure ?
i ll bet there s another flight to minsk in like  that s really beautiful .
what does it mean ?
that s good .
i got to admit , i thought it was something else .
you re right !
you re right .
don t say it .
i do too .
okay , now s not the time joey .
all right ?
you can yell at me tomorrow .
no !
no !
no pheebs , i m not going to yell at you .
i just y know , started thinking about you and david and i remember how bummed you were the first time he left .
and i just  oh pheebs , come here .
are you okay ?
no i m not okay .
the only guy i ve ever been crazy about has gone to minsk and i may never i may never see him again .
hey , y know you could always visit him .
oh right , like they re going to let me have a passport .
anything i can do ?
whatever you need .
well but now , if if you can achieve positronic distillation of sub atomic particles y know before he does , then he can come back .
i can give it a shot .
oh !
yay !
look !
there s a piece that doesn t have floor on it !
stick to your side !
hey , come on now !
all right , what are we havin  ?
oh wait i forgot my wrap .

look , you re going to have to help me out here ,  because i only have three .
oh my god .
richard ?
hi !
wow !
your lip went bald .
hey , thanks .
right .
what ?
that s because i i was just grabbing some things out of the dryer , and it s static cling .
or maybe it s just that god knew i d be running into you and saw an opportunity .
it s good to see you too .
you see that guy ?
he s in classics now , but y'know as soon as we leave he s going straight to the porn .
yeah .

okay ?
hmm .
for every night that you re asleep before i get home from work .
.
.
yeah .
i will wake you up in a way that s proved very popular in the past .
now , if you need to stay late , i want to be supportive of that .
right .
hi .
look at you .
since when do you roller blade ?
oh !
since tomorrow .
i met this really cute guy in the park and he like y'know , jogs , and blades , and swims , and so y'know we made a deal that s he s going to teach me all sorts of jock stuff .
and what are you going to do for him ?
i m going to let him .
okay .
cool .
morning .
somebody got in late last night .
yeah well , i ran into richard .
when did this happen ?
oh , um , around 8:02 .
we ah , talked for a little while , and then um , we went out for an innocent burger .
oh , there s no such thing as an innocent burger .
so , are you going to see him again ?
tomorrow night .
monica , what are you doing ?
well , she spent the last six months getting over him , and now she s celebrating that by going on a date with him .
it s not a date , okay .
i m just going to teach him how to make lasagne for some pot luck dinner he has .
well , you might want to make a little extra , y'know you ll probably be hungry after the sex .
we re not going to have sex !
okay , nothing s changed here .
he still doesn t want children and i still do , so that s why we re just going to be friends .
naked friends .
hey .
hey .
do you have any ice ?
check the freezer .
if there s none in there , then we re probably out .
are you just getting in from work ?
it s late .
yeah , i know .
i had the greatest day though , i got to sit in on the meeting with the reps from calvin klien .
i told my boss i liked this line of lingerie , she ordered a ton of it .
how was your day ?
i discovered i m able to count all of my teeth using just my tongue .
hmm .
umm , why do you have a copy of the shining in your freezer ?
oh , i was reading it last night , and i got scared , so .
but ah , you re safe from it if it s in the freezer ?

but jo s got a crush on laurie .
oh .
you mean it s like a girl girl thing ?

it s a word !
yeah , i do think it s better this way .
yeah , we re being smart .
yes , i m sure .
i ll call you back .
so we can be friends who sleep together .
sounds smart and healthy to me .
so um , just out of curiosity , um , do you currently have any other racquetball buddies ?
oh .
no !
no !
because if you do that means you d be cancelling it for me , and we re just friends .
hey .
ooh !
don t sit down !
yeah .
and , first here s a gift .
stretchy pants !
why , those are the greatest things in the world !
if i were you i would wear them every day , every day !
that s all right , that s well , i figured .
.
.
.
hey !
how s it going ?
good .
hey , rach , how you doing with the shining ?
oh , danny just went into room 217 .
oooh , the next part s the best , when that dead lady in the bathtub .

all right i ll talk in code .
remember when the kid sees those two blanks in the hallway ?
hmmm , that s very cool .
oh , all blank , and no blank , make s blank a blank blank .
oh no no no , no , the end when jack almost kills them all with that blank , but then at last second they get away .
aww !
joey !
i can t believe you just did that !
i can t believe she cracked your code !
all right , okay , laurie proposes to jo , and she says no , even though she s still in love with him , and then he ends up marring amy .
hey !
mine was by accident !
all right , the boiler explodes and destroys the hotel , and kills the dad .
eh .
beth dies .
beth , beth dies ?
um hmm .
is that true ?
if i keep reading is beth going to die ?
no , beth doesn t die , she doesn t die .
does she rachel ?
what ?
!
joey s asking if you ve just ruined the first book he s ever loved that didn t star jack nicholson ?
no .
she doesn t die .
then why would you say that ?
!
because , i wanted to hurt you .
oh my .
.
.
.
hi .
sorry .
i m sorry .
you would not believe my day !
i had to work two shifts , and then to top it off , i lost one of my fake boobs ,  in a grill fire .
what are you smiling at ?
i m sorry , i was just thinking you re day could still pick up .
yeah , right .
i love this friend thing !
listen , robert s going to be here any second so , will one of you just tell him ?
oh .
please , right now , no , every time i see him it s like  is it on the lose ?
is it watching me ?
we can t tell him , you can t go up to a guy you barely know and talk about his .
.
.
.
stuff .
he s right , even if it s to say something complementary .
hey .
no , i can spot you from here .
okay , listen robert .
.
.
hey , don t we have to .
.
.
yeah , we got , um hmm .
umm , i think you re really , really great .
.
.
i i i i i don t know , i don t know what to say .
ow !
oh my god !
oh my god !
so um , who was she ?
did you like her ?
and i m just asking as a friend , because i am totally fine with this .
okay , y'know what , i m not fine , i m not .
i mean how can i be fine , hearing you come in with her , she wants to see your bedroom .
.
.
.
y'know what , what if we re friends who don t see other people ?
why not ?
!
i mean this has been the most amazing week .
would it be so terrible ?
even if we were friends who lived together .
or , maybe someday friends who stood up in front of their other friends , and vowed to be friends forever .
that s not true , you don t have a moustache .
y'know what , i ve got to walk out of here right now ,  because getting over you is the hardest thing that i have ever had to do .
i don t think i could do it again .
how  bout one last game of racquetball ?
watch the thorns !
what ?
beth is really , really sick .
awwww .
jo s there , but i don t think there s anything she could do .
joey ?
yeah .
do you want to put the book in the freezer ?
okay .
okay .
okay , she is the star of the play .
and she is my girlfriend !
i get to have sex with the star of the play !
people can hear you .
i know !
!
wow !
she looks great .
doesn t she ?
yeah .
that is one good looking man !
is it just me , or can you actually see his abs through his overcoat ?
!
dude !
here s your girlfriend s button .
oh , hey , mon , do you still have your like old blouses and dresses from high school ?
yeah , i think i have some around here somewhere .
why ?
well , it s just that maternity clothes are so expensive .
hey , rach !
i made a pile of your stuff over on this side of the room .
if you could just throw your purses at it .
bloomingdale s eliminated my department .
oh my god , are you out of a job ?
no , but they stuck me in personal shopping .
which is just a huge step down !
personal shopping ?
what is that ?
like where you walk around with snooty rich people and tell them what to buy ?
uh huh .
that sounds great !
hey !
umm , excuse me , we switched apartments .
you can t eat are food anymore , that that gravy train had ended .
there s gravy ?
if you have the big apartment you have to deal with people coming over all the time .
that fridge has got to be stocked , okay , that s your department now .
what are you doing ?
i think i left a donut up here .
hey !
hey !
hey !
ooh !
how was kathy s play ?
well , kathy gets half naked and simulates sex with a real good lookin  guy .
yeah , it s like someone literally wrote down my worst nightmare and then charged me $32 to see it !
that s a good idea for a business !
i m totally screwed .
okay , they are going to be hot and heavy on stage every night , and then they re going to go to their cast parties and he s going to try to undermine me .
y'know it ll be like , so where s your boyfriend , what s his name , chester ?
and she ll go , no no no , it s chandler .
and he ll go , whatever .
ha ha ha ha !
that that is a good trick .
all right , look , look , what am i going to do ?
chandler , look they re actors .
they re there to do a job , just  because they work together , doesn t mean they re going to get together .
i mean just  because it happened with susan sarandon and tim robbins , it doesn t mean it s going to happen with them .
oh oh , alec baldwin and kim basinger .
tom cruise and nicole kidman .
yeah .
hey , mel gibson and clint eastwood .
they re not a couple !
oh okay , i get the game now .
okay look , look , let me ask you a question , when they were doing it on stage , was it like really hot ?
oh yeah !
well okay , so then you re fine .
the rule is when two actors are actually doing it off stage all the sexual tension between them is gone .
okay ?
so as long as it s hot onstage you got nothing to worry about .
it s when the heat goes away , that s when you re in trouble .
really ?
look , you guys have been to every play i ve ever been in , have i ever had chemistry on stage ?
no .
noooo !
!
so uh , man , are you going to go to the play with me tonight ?
y know what , i don t know how comfortable i am going to see how hot the sex is between some guy and your girlfriend .
yeah , i know but  oh no no no , i m there .
hey !
hey mon !
want some pancakes ?
you made pancakes ?
yep !
grab a plate .
okay .
no no , stay right there .
gettin  closer .
okay , okay , but don t worry , because we also have cereals , muffins , waffles , and , jams , jellies , and marmalades .
which i m fairly certain are the same thing .
listen also we re uh , we re watching the game here saturday night , if people want to come over .
oh yeah !
oh , i was thinking about having people over for the game .
oh yeah , who s playing ?
the players .
somebody seems to be missing being the hostess .
please , it s a relief is what it is , is what it is .
all right pheebs , stick out your plate !
oh .
monica , i m quitting !
i just helped an 81 year old woman put on a thong and she didn t even buy it !
i m telling you i m quitting !

there was like no chemistry between them .
before they had heat , and now there s no heat !
now you know what this means , joey told us what this means !
all right , let s not jump to any conclusions .

there was some sexual chemistry between them .
come on , it was like cousins having sex up there !
here she comes .
don t say a word , okay ?
just be cool , don t be y'know you .
hey !
oh , absolutely !
oh , i loved the play .
you were great , and nick ditto .
clearly you re having sex with him .
okay , i   oh come on , it was so obvious !
there was no chemistry between you two !
y know , i i could see how this could happen , y'know you re up there every night , you re naked , touching , kissing .
well , you can understand , given how we started .
well , that is what happened , and i don t even see you denying this !
yeah , well , don t expect that to happen anytime soon !
i have the best job in the entire world !
the most adorable guy came over today , and i got to dress him up all day !
rachel has a new doll .
oh , i wish he was a doll , then i could get a rachel doll and bump them together and make kissy noises .

i m the hostess !
not those guys !
i m always the hostess !
i mean , i was always the hostess , i mean even when i was little , i mean the girls brought their dollies to my tea party , i i served the best air .
well , why did you make like a whole big thing out of y'know , everyone has to hang out in the big apartment ?
because they took our apartment , i wanted to punish them .
but i m i m done now .
they ve suffered enough .
if you wanted to punish them , you should ve just made them hang out here !
yeah , that s true .
all right then , when i m done with this place , it s going to be ten times better than that place !
oh , are we going to trash that place ?
steps !
slut !
you will all be very happy to hear that kathy is sleeping with that guy !
so you were right ?
i confronted her , and she didn t deny it !
i don t live here !
chandler !
chandler , what did she say ?
wait a minute .
come here .
are you sure ?
well , i may be drunk , but i know what she said !

oh , hey , do you need help with that ?
nah , i got it .

it s just so frustrating !
why don t you ask him out ?
oh , yeah , totally !
that s such a turn on !
really ?
it doesn t seem desperate ?
oh ooh , that s the turn on .
he just got a divorce right ?
hmm mmm .
so he s probably really nervous around women , y'know ?
maybe , you just have to make the first move .
yeah but , i ve never asked a guy out before .
you ve never asked a guy out ?
!
!
no .
have you ?
thousands of times !
!
that doesn t make me sound too good does it ?
i don t even know how i would go about it .
oh oh oh oh , how i do it is , i look a woman up and down and say , hey , how you doin  ?
oh , please !
hey , how you doin  ?
you know what , i m going to do that , i m going to call him up , and i m going to ask him out .

i ll see you tomorrow .
bye .
you ve done that a thousand times ?
i ve never done that .
ohh , god , i just got so nervous that he would say no .
well , you got to give him something that he can t say no too .
like uh , knicks tickets !
invite the guy to a knicks game , you re guaranteed he ll say yes !
really ?
!
you think that will work ?
absolutely !
and if it doesn t , can i get the extra ticket ?
what the heck is that ?
did she call ?
no , sorry .

no !
forget her , man !
you don t need her , you don t need that !
he s right , what she did was unforgivable .
well , yeah , but y'know , what what if i was wrong ?
how might you be wrong ?
well y'know , what if she didn t actually sleep with the guy ?
dude , tell me she actually told you this .
she did not have to tell me , i saw the play , and there was no heat .
back me up here , ross !
that s all you re basing this on ?
that s not backing me up !
look , you said with the off stage and the heat , and the onstage and the oy heat .
whoa whoa , that that was just a theory !
there s a lot of theories that didn t pan out .
the lone gunman .

y know ?
i know i acted like the biggest idiot in the world , and i can completely understand why you were so upset .
yeah , i know , i i wish i had too , but y know i i think this is a good thing .
y'know ?
because we ve had our first fight , and now we can move on .

well , she wasn t sleeping with him .
oh good !
she is now .
what are you saying ?
i m saying that she  is a devil woman !
y know i mean you think you know someone and then they turn around and they sleep with nick !
nick , with his rock hard pecs , and his giant man nipples !
i hate him , i hate her !
well , i don t hate her , i love her .
this is all my fault really .
how ?
how is your fault ?
because , i i should ve called !
y know if i had just called her after our big , stupid fight , she never would ve gone out with nick , and they would ve ended up in bed together .
i threw her at his man nipples !
honey , this is not your fault , just because you guys had a fight , it does not justify her sleeping with someone .
well , if if she thought they were on a break  really ?
yes !
i will !
absolutely !
hello , rachel .
hi , joshua .
i left my wallet here on purpose .
really ?
yes , i just wanted to see you again .
oh , i m glad .
rachel , i d like to say something to you .
yes ?
how you doin  ?
hey !
hey !
check it out !
this is unbelievable !
joey has been holding his breath for almost four minutes !
dude !
what are yo you trying to kill me ?
!
pheebs , i want to ask you something .
uh huh , what ?
well since i m movin  out and and you re so beautiful  oh !
how about i move in with you ?
well , that would be great but then what do we do about denise ?
who s denise ?
my roommate .
you have a roommate ?
!
yes , denise .
denise !
hey , what is with the secrecy phoebe ?
huh ?
and what about this denise , is she cute ?
pheebs , i don t understand .
how can you have a roommate that none of us know anything about ?
maybe because you never listen to anything that i say .
i talk about her all the time !
denise !
!
!
!
!
hey rach , listen i was thinkin  uh , i m going to have an extra room over at my place  oh , that s true .
yeah , why don t you move in with me ?
it ll be great !
we could stay up late , watch movies , and you know about naked thursday s right ?
yeah , yeah i think i m going to find my own place .
hey hey !
i thought naked thursday s was just our thing man !
hey .
hey !
so , what did rachel say when you told her you were still married to her ?
oh , that .
umm , she took it really well .
you didn t tell her did you ?
no .
of course not , because you re in love with her .
i am not in love with her .
she was very upset about having to move out so i eh , didn t tell her we were still married because she would only get more upset .
i i just comforted her , as a friend .
what do you mean , comforted her ?
it s nothing , i just gave her a hug .
ah ha !
a classic sign of love , the hug !
it s also a sign of friendship .
yeah , not in your case lovey loverson .
it was a hug !
okay , just tell me this , did you or did you not smell her hair ?
s s smell her hair ?
what if i did ?
ninety percent of a women s pheromones come out the top of her head !
that s why , that s why women are shorter .
so that men will fall in love when they hug them !
oh come on ross , you re a scientist .
i was hugging her as a friend .
it s not my fault her her hair got in my face , she s got a lot of it and it smells all all uh coconutty .
what ?
!
oh , that doesn t mean i have feelings for rachel !
maybe it means i have feelings for coconuts !
okay , whatever you say .
but just be careful , all right ?
rachel s not in the same place you are .
if the place you are referring too is being in love , then she is in the same place as me because i am not in that place !
okay , i didn t understand that , but y know , maybe that s  because you were speaking the secret language of love !
hey !
dude , some guy just called for you .
who was it ?
i don t know !
how about , thanks for taking the message .
jeez !
okay listen , y know when you move in rachel s room is going to be empty , you want to talk about what we want to do with it ?
sure !
okay , i was thinking we should have a beautiful guest room , right ?
with a mahogany sleigh bed and bedside tables with flowers on them all the time !
and we could have a roll top desk with comment cards on them so people could say how much they loved staying here !
!
okay , whatever , i really haven t thought about it that much .
well , i like that idea .
obviously !
i was thinking maybe maybe maybe it could be a game room , y know ?
i mean you can buy old arcade games like uh , like space invaders and asteroids for $200 , the real ones !
the big big ones !
no .
okay so you mean no as in , gee chandler , what an interesting idea .
let s discuss it before we reject it completely .
oh , i m sorry .
of course i mean that .
interesting idea , umm , talk about it , but no .
so , that s it ?
i just don t think arcade games go in the beautiful guest room .
the beautiful guest room is going to be filled with antiques .
which is why asteroids is perfect !
it s the oldest game !
what do you have against the beautiful guest room ?
i don t have anything against the beautiful guest room , especially since everybody we know lives about 30 seconds away !
are you mocking me ?
no , i m not mocking you ,  or you beautiful guest room .
hey , what s up ?
nothing , monica and i had a stupid fight .
but you re still moving in together , right ?
because my ad came out today .
wanted .
female roommate , non smoker , non ugly .
nice !
yeah ?
i just figured y know , after living with you it d be an interesting change of pace to have a female roommate , y know ?
someone i can learn from , someone someone who s different than me .
and what s more different than me ; a guy who s not 19 than say a girl who is 19 ?
enh ?
not just a hat rack my friend !
pheebs , i have to ask you  shhhhhh !
i m swamped right now .
you re just staring into space .
umm , i m trying to move that pencil .
this one ?
it worked !
pheebs , this whole apartment thing is just a nightmare !
every place i can afford comes with a roommate who is a freak .
i mean , look at this ;  wanted .
female roommate , non smoker , non ugly .
it s just , there is nothing !
the city s full !
wait , no , look at this !
two bedroom , two bath , must be non smoker , satan worshipers okay   oh , yeah , but it s on the ground floor .
hey !
hey .
rach , uh , you still looking for a place ?
yeah !
why ?
okay , there s this guy , warren , from the museum and he s going on a dig for like two years and he s got this great place he needs to sublet .
so uh , you interested ?
that sounds great !
i d love to live at warren s !
!
i love warren !
thank you !
don t thank me !
if you want to thank something , thank the volcano that erupted thousands of years ago , killing but perfectly preserving an entire civilization .
here s warren s number .
oh , this is great !
i am going to call him right now !
oh , thank you !
okay , you go grab it !
i saw it .

oh , i have to go tell monica what a wonderful brother she has !
oh please !
you re going to say things now , aren t ya ?
no .
no , i won t .
but i should tell you this , this exact same thing happened to my roommate denise .
she moved in with a guy who was secretly married to her and he said he didn t love her , but he really did , and it just blew up !
and that s how she ended up living with me !
okay , that s a lie .
hi .
hi .
hi , listen , i m sorry about before .
i don t need to have a game room .
i mean when i was a kid i only played those games because i couldn t get girls , and now i can  them now , i have you .
not not that i think that i have you or think of you as property in any sort of way , i see women  stop it chandler .
i m sorry too .
really ?
yeah !
oh yes !
ohh .
listen , we don t have to make that a guest room , we can think of something to do with the room together .
that s a great idea !
we can easily think of a way for us both to enjoy the room .
totally !
we don t have to come up with this now .
oh good .
hey , y know what ?
why don t we think about changes we can make in the living room ?
changes ?
yeah , i mean we re going to have to move around some furniture to make room for my chair .
you re you re you re going to bring the barca lounger over here ?
is that a problem ?
well , it s a set and they should probably stay together .
oh , that s cool .
then i ll just bring them both over .
see now now you re taking them away from their home .
okay , i get it .
so , i get nothing !
nothing here is mine !
everything here is yours !
i ll get up in the morning put on your clothes , and head off to work !
yeah yeah , y know what ?
yeah , that s it that s it , everything will be mine !
nothing will be yours !
that s that s what i said !
oh come on , chandler !
i m talking about the barca lounger !
it just , it doesn t match !
where is it going to go ?
!
in the game room !
look it is not my fault that your chairs are incredibly ugly !
all right !
that s fine !
that s fine !
i won t bring over the chairs !
i won t bring anything over !
i wouldn t want to ruin the ambiance over here at grandma s place !
!
everything on your application looks really good ohh !
just one last question umm , are you and your friends going to be over here all the time like partying and hanging out ?
whoa !
!
now look , don t be just blurtin  stuff out .
i want you to really think about your answers .
okay ?
you can call off the roommate search !
hi !
i ll be living here .
oh don t listen to him , he s just some guy who really wants the apartment , but i don t think he s going to get it .
why did you take the shower curtain down ?
that thing was a hazard !
i m very safety conscious .
hey !
hey !
oh listen , i was just clearing some space for your stuff .
oh thanks , but listen , i was just at monica s and she and chandler had a big fight and they re not moving in .
what do you mean , they re not moving in ?
they they re still moving in right ?
no no , they just had a big blowout over what to do with my room .
what ?
!
over a stupid room !
yeah , i feel kind of bad for them , but i m also really psyched  because i don t have to move in here !
oh no , yeah no , that part s great !
what s all this about you guys fighting ?
!
is this really over a room ?
!
i mean , that is so silly !
ross , we can handle this .
well , apparently not , and i can t just stand by and watch two people i care about very much be hurt over something that is so silly .
i mean , enough of the silliness !
well , why don t you tell her to stop being silly !
okay okay !
two very good points , look i ve known you both a long time , and i ve never seen either of you one/millionth as happy as you ve been since you ve got together .
do you really want to throw that all away over a room ?
that is so silly .
now wh what is more important , love or silliness ?
well , we are fond of the silliness , but we also have a soft spot for the love .
love is the best medicine .
that s laughter .
why do you do it ?
i don t know .
okay !
all right !
now , chandler you you want to live with monica , right ?
yeah , i do .
and mon , you want to live with chandler , don t ya ?
yes .
good !
a verbal contract is binding in the state of new york !
no no , i m staying put .
why , where are you going ?
hey rach !
hi !
you re never going to believe it uh , monica and chandler are moving in again .
that s great news right i mean for them .
right ?
oh wow .
yeah but , on the bright side , we get to be roommates again .
yeah .
y know umm , uh , umm , about that , umm , ross i really appreciate your offer to let me move in and everything , but don t you think it s going to be weird ?
wh why ?
!
why why why would it , why would it be weird ?
well , because of us !
because of our history .
no !
no ?
no !
no !
it would be weird if we were still in that place , i mean are you still in that place ?
no !
not at all !
good !
me neither !
so it s not a problem .
we re just two friends who happen to be roommates .
okay , but ross , eventually you and i are going to be dating .
really ?
!
we are ?
yeah !
i m going to have a boyfriend , you re going to have a girlfriend  ohh !
that would be great .
but y know what , if you think it s going to be okay we ll just work out a system .
y know , it ll be like college , i ll hang a hanger on the door and put a sign , come back later , i m gettin  lucky .
yeah , i didn t think of that .
so are you sure about this whole moving in thing ?
!
i mean it s a really big step !
and and what s the rush ?
!
that s very funny !
he s being silly , because he knows that we enjoy the silliness !
no , i i i m serious , okay ?
i mean , think about it .
you move in , you start fighting over stupid game rooms , next thing y know you break up !
ross , you were right before , it was just a stupid fight about a room .
okay , there are no stupid fights !
!
this isn t about the room , this is about what the room represents !
and unfortunately , this room  could destroy you !
!
yeah , I am not so worried .
yeah , no , me neither .
fine !
it s your life !
i just don t want to see you guys break up !
which you will do if you move in together ,  but that s what you want , there s nothing i can do .
don t do it !
!
!
!
!
you still want to move in together right ?
of course !
ross didn t scare you ?
scared me out of ever wanting to live with him .
come here , i want to show you something !
okay !
oh my god !
someone s killed square man !
this is where i thought the barca lounger could go !
you see you could see the tv and it s still walking distance to the kitchen .
oh that s so sweet !
i want to show you something too !
okay !
y know those big big uh , road signs that say merge ?
uh hmm .
y know ?
so i was thinking that we could get one of those signs and hang it over our bed .
because , that s you and i together !
merge !
oh my god !
i love that !
really ?
!
uh , no !
!
i found you in my bed !
now if you want to receive e mails about my upcoming shows , then please give me money so i can buy a computer .
so umm , where are the other guys ?
umm , well let s see monica and chandler are occupied .
fighting ?
!
no , the other thing .
i really think it s great they work things out .
yeah .
there s no breaking them up , is there ?
hey , can i borrow the key to your house so i can run across the street and make a copy ?
sure !
here .
thank you .
now are you sure ?
because once i make a copy , there s no turning back .
yeah , i m i m sure .
yeah , get out of here before i change my mind .
umm , listen , ross do you really think this moving in with rachel is a good idea ?
i ve been back and forth .
yeah well , maybe you should go back !
okay ?
rachel moves in , and before you know it you re right where you don t want to be !
back together !
ehh , i don t , i don t think so .
she s already talked about y know , dating other guys .
that s not going to work out !
then she s going to come home all weepy and you ll be tellin  her , oh that s okay .
you ll find someone .
and then , bamn !
she finds you !
yeah , well , m maybe you re right .
i am telling you ross , she is definitely going to fall in love with you again !
now , is that what you want ?
is that what i want ?
yes .
here she comes .
hold on , i m going to make your life much easier .
all right , well the place was closed .
i ll just copy it later .
or not .
uh , rach , why don t you just move in with me ?
whoa !
whoa !
whoa , joey !
no no no no no no no no  it s okay , i mean i look rach , i know i scared you off with that whole naked thursday s thing , but we don t have to do that !
well , it would be easier to move just right across the hall .
wait a minute , unless you re thinking about naked wednesday s .
thursday s clearly not good for ya , pick a day !
hi !
come in .
thanks for comin  back , umm , okay there have been a lot of people interested in the room , but i have narrowed it down and you are one of the finalists !
okay now , before i make my final decision i uh , i just want to make sure our personalities match .

that was one good minute !
good night .

ohh , i m so happy for you !
oh , well , that s great !
yeah !
yeah !
i can t believe you re getting married !
yeah .
monica and rachel made out .
hey !
get into gear !
okay !
hey hon , could you help me get the plates down ?
yeah .
hey , here is an idea , why do not we use our wedding china today ?
no , i think we should save our china for something really special .
like if the queen of england comes over .
honey , she keeps canceling on us , take the hint .
what if something gets broken , they are so expensive .
what is the point of having them if we never use them ?
ok , but if something gets broken , and then the queen comes over .
.
i will explain it to her .
<laughs > oh yeah , like I am going to let you talk to the queen .
wow , the parade is really good this year .
man those horses can crap .
muskogee !
that is like four hours from tulsa .
woo hoo !
oh my god !
are not you one of the stars of the popular daytime soap days of our lives ?
yeah !
i totally forgot I am supposed to be there .
i can not believe i forgot .
i usually write stuff like this on my arm .
what are you going to do ?
i guess I am going to have to come up with a really good reason why i was not there .
the producers are going to be so mad at me .
they sat us all down yesterday and said everyone has to be there at 6:00 am sharp , that means you tribbiani .
like .
.
like i was some kind of idiot .
well you proved them wrong .
a lot of people are thankful for those .
who is it ?
hide my rings .
oh .
<opens door preparing herself and then happily says > um .
.
.
hi .
aw .
i have not seen you in like .
.
a year .
oh well yeah me too .
um .
.
i had a baby .
oh .
.
yeah ?
well unless you pushed a desk out of your vagina , <shakes head no > not the same thing .
mh hmm .
.
uh .
.
.
.
its emma .
hey amy .
oh amy , you remember ross .
that was me .
careful .
<hands chandler a china plate > careful .
careful !
I will tell you what , for the rest of our lives , I will be careful until told otherwise .
<looks at china > hey wait a minute this is not the china we picked out .
.
i know , after you left the store , i chose different ones .
why ?
well no offense honey , but your taste is a little feminine for me .
oh suddenly , flowers are feminine ?
hey , everybody .
happy thanksgiving !
hey happy thanksgiving .
.
pheebs !
<motions her to come over > hey , what is going on joe ?
i .
.
i .
.
i need a good lie .
oh okay .
how about the whole man walking on the moon  thing .
you know ?
you .
you could .
you could see the strings people !
no , no , no i need a good lie to explain why i was not at a work thing today .
ooh , honey .
you stink at lying .
i do not .
oh really .
okay .
let me ask you something .
yesterday at the coffee house , i went to the bathroom and when i came back , my muffin was gone who took it ?
somebody opened the door to the coffee house and a raccoon came running in , went straight for your muffin and i said hey do not eat that that is phoebe's  and he said .
.
<pause > he said .
.
joey you stink at lying .
what am i going to do ?
do not worry , do not worry .
we will come up with a good lie .
I will help you practice it .
oh great , that would be great .
thank you .
sure , what .
.
what was the work thing ?
uh .
.
<forgetting what the work thing was , rolls up his sleeve on his right arm and shows phoebe , she looks > pick up grandma at the airport  ?
oh .
.
man .
.
amy !
<pause > yes i do .
.
i really do .
<grabs ross ' hand for support > sure , we do not live there but .
.
.
yeah , no .
ross has a phd .
god she is unbelievable .
i know , i mean a phd is just as good as an md .
oh sure ross , yeah .
if i have a heart attack in a restaurant , i want you there with your fossil brush .
what ?
what happened ?
do not say that .
oh amy , do not cry amy .
um .
.
ross , could i talk to you in private ?
sure , you want to go upstairs ?
um look i was thinking .
.
if its ok with monica i would like to invite amy to thanksgiving .
you know , i think that is a great idea .
it will be like the pilgrims bringing the indians syphilis .
look i know she is a little tough to take .
she has no where else to go , and she is my sister .
alright , she is emma's aunt .
and i would like them to bond .
ok , fine , but i do not want them bonding to much .
i do not want her telling emma she needs a nose job .
ross , you know what ?
she may need one  we are just going to have to make our peace with that !
hey you guys , this is my sister amy .
this is chandler , joey , phoebe and you know mon .
pheebs , i still need some help here oh right , ok um .
ok so its not just the lie you tell .
but its the way you tell it .
.
for example if you look down at the ground when you are talking , people know you are lying .
oh .
.
i do not know why this is so hard for me .
you know .
.
i mean lying is basically just acting and i am a terrfic actor .
oh we just put her down for a nap .
that is a great movie .
<she claps > emma .
phoe be .
honey , i do not know how to tell you this , but um , if something were to happen to ross or to myself <ross and rachel knock on wood > um you would not get the baby .
well we have not offically asked them yet , but we would want monica and chandler .
i can not believe you would want us to raise emma .
yeah oh my god , I am so moved .
see look amy , we are a lot closer to monica and chandler .
we see them every day .
and truthfully honey , you do not seem very connected to the baby .
you know , guys i got to say .
this means so much to me .
that you would trust me with your child .
i mean , we all know that monica and i have been trying to have a baby of our own .
you know I have had my doubts about my skills as a father , but that you two .
.
that you two .
.
.
.
<starts to cry > okay !
it is time for dinner .
everyone we are using our fancy china .
.
um and its very expensive so please be careful .
okay , just to be clear comedy with the plates will not be well recieved .
<pinches ross ' arm > hey !
how come my plate's less fancy then everyone else's ?
do you not trust me with a fancy plate ?
no , honey , its .
that is a special plate .
see its a game , whoever gets that plate wins .
i can not believe i won .
monica is ross ' sister .
that was me .
hey .
amy .
you have got to stop doing that .
now see , this way you protect the plate .
.
and let us face it you have fun .
no , if crazy plate lad .
.
<sees monica frustrated at this comment > if monica dies then i would get emma , right ?
well actually .
.
.
actually what ?
well .
.
its just .
its just in that case , then um .
emma would go to my parents .
what ?
so if monica's not around , then I am not good enough to raise emma ?
yeah he is lying .
he looked down .
well what is wrong with me ?
am i  .
.
am i incomptent ?
because i managed to survive whatever it is that killed the three of you !
honey , you are taking this the wrong way .
we think you are going to be a wonderful parent .
it is just .
.
you are more the fun parent .
yeah and we would want to make sure emma has someone like monica who is more uh .
uh discliplinarin .
.
someone who can be firm and strict .
that is not how you see me , is it ?
look , i may not know a lot about babies , but do you really think I am not capable ?
no , you both are equally capable .
its just .
.
you are strongest when .
.
when you are together .
ok .
so if we both had emma and i die <knocks on table >  she would have to give her up .
sure , monica would have to give her up .
i lie better then that , right ?
so .
.
let me get this straight .
so my two friends die , i get emma .
then my wife dies , then emma the one tiny ray of hope left in my life gets taken away from me ?
there is your movie !
<claps > hey .
there you are .
you disappeared after dinner .
oh ?
did somebody miss me ?
is there a child to raise poorly ?
ross and rachel do not know what they are talking about .
i mean its not like their so responsible .
emma is a product of a bottle of merlot and a five year old condom .
yeah but they are right .
i mean , I am not a strong father figure and i never will be .
no you learn these things .
you grow into it .
yeah , but its not who i am .
everything they said was exaclty why i was worried about having a kid .
and its true .
and look everybody knows it .
i do not know it !
i want to have a kid with you because i think you are going to be an amazing dad .
.
.
at the fun parts and the hard parts .
oh yeah , well can you picture me saying go to your room !
you are grounded  ?
can you hear me say you are grounded  ?
you said that to me last week .
how hard is it ?
no shoes on the furniture .
it is ok .
i thought of the perfect lie for you .
it is easy to remember and does not invite a lot of questions .
you were not at the parade because you had a family emergency .
oh , i like that , yeah .
was not at the parade because i had a family emergency .
ooh , what happened ?
no !
nothing with a raccoon .
arg .
.
.
alright , I will take care of it .
<throws hands out in the air > oh wait .
.
what are you doing ?
setting the table .
yeah we thought it would be nice to use the fancy china for dessert too .
oh how nice .
maybe later we can all go blow our noses on my wedding dress .
hey dude , you okay ?
sorry about before .
oh no that is okay , you are totally right .
i do not know anything about disciplining a child .
but it did hurt my feelings and i want you to know that when i die , you do not get joey .
uchh !
<much louder and longer then amy's > yeah .
.
yeah right .
.
remember in high school when i died and did not give you my baby ?
what ?
what carrer ?
ok .
you decorate dad's office and so now you are a decorator .
okay !
i went to the zoo yesterday and now I am a koala bear .
sup .
.
you want to talk supportive ?
you did not even come and visit me when i was in the hospital having the baby .
i did the first time !
oh .
oh .
.
<gets up and walks into the kitchen > and you know what .
you want to know why I am not giving emily to you .
emma .
ooh oooh .
.
uh huh .
jealous of what ?
of your lack of responsiblity ?
you , your immaturity ?
your total disregard of other people's feelings ?
timmy was my boyfriend and you made out with him !
i cannot , i cannot believe that i invited you here today .
ah ha ha .
ah ha ha .
<evil meancing laughter > it is forty five .
you take that back .
take it back !
heey man , i work out .
i do pilates .
bring it on !
put the plates in the boxes !
!
put the plates in the boxes !
did you just push me ?
alright .
that is it !
<pushes amy back > oh my god !
should not we stop this ?
what ?
are you out of your mind ?
let us throw some jello on them .
ew !
gross .
alright !
that is it .
this is our apartment and you can not behave this way .
now if you can not act your age then you should not be here at all .
now those plates may not be as nice as the pretty pink ones i picked out , but they are very important to monica .
i want you to apologize to her right now .
mon , I am so sorry .
okay .
that is better .
now i want you to both apologize to each other and mean it .
by the way , that fight was totally arousing .
dude .
well done .
you know what ?
if i die , and rachel dies and monica dies then you can totally take care of emma .
oh yeah ?
well thanks .
so , so now do i get joey ?
okay , but you should know he eats five times a day and shoves pennies up his nose .
are you okay mon ?
uh huh .
.
i mean these things happen .
its ' just a plate .
its not like somebody died .
it is all right .
you can mourn .
actually its not pies , its just pie .
i do not care .
<pauses and realizes .
.
.
> oh my god .
I have lost the will to scold .
look amy , it got a little of control  um .
.
and I am sorry .
you are my sister and uh .
.
if it really means that much to you .
.
uh .
no .
.
i was going to let you use my ralph lauren discount .
she needs changing .
oh no no no .
.
I will get her .
I am super compentent and totally responsibile and fourth in line to raise emma .
I will be right there emma .
just let me get my trusty diaper bag here .
<knocks over the box of china > well .
.
what do you know ?
i guess , I will be the one who dies first .
hey , does monica know about her broken plates yet ?
nope .
.
.
broke them all , huh ?
yep .
.
.
you going to tell her ?
nope .
.
.
hey .
.
.
so I am going to .
.
.
put the plates back .
you know , i think you were right , i do not think we should use these plates again for a looong time .
like only if the queen comes ?
maybe not even then .
hey !
i did it .
i called my producer .
i told him i had a family emergency , he totally bought it .
thanks for teaching me how to lie pheebs .
no problem !
next week : stealing .
.
.
bye plates !
oh , you told her you broke all the plates , huh ?
what ?
something happened with the plates ?
uhm .
.
.
yeah .
.
.
this uhm .
.
.
raccoon came in .
.
.
how could someone get a hold of your credit card number ?
i have no idea .
but look how much they spent !
monica , would you calm down ?
the credit card people said that you only have to pay for the stuff that you bought .
i know .
it is just such reckless spending .
i think when someone steals your credit card , they have kind of already thrown caution to the wind .
wow , what a geek .
they spent $69.95 on a wonder mop .
that is me .
oh !
the yuk !
ross , he is doing it again !
marcel , stop humping the lamp !
stop humping !
now marcel , come back    come here , marcel   oh no , not in my room !
I will get him .
ross , you have got to do something about the humping .
what ?
it is , it is just a phase .
well , that is what we said about joey .
.
.
would you all relax ?
it is not that big a deal .
stop it !
marcel !
bad monkey !
what ?
let us just say my curious george doll is no longer curious .
oh , monica .
you are not still going over that thing .
this woman's living my life .
what ?
she is living my life , and she is doing it better than me !
look at this , look .
she buys tickets for plays that i want to see .
she , she buys clothes from stores that I am intimidated by the sales people .
she spent three hundred dollars on art supplies .
you are not an artist .
yeah , well i might be if i had the supplies !
i mean , i could do all this stuff .
only i do not .
oh , monica , c'mon , you do cool things .
oh really ?
okay , let us compare , shall we .
oh , it is so late for 'shall we ' .
.
.
do i go horseback riding in the park ?
do i take classes at the new school ?
nooo .
.
.
this is so unfair !
she is got everything i want , and she does not have my mother .
how about joey .
.
.
pepponi ?
no , still too ethnic .
my agent thinks i should have a name that is more neutral .
joey .
.
.
switzerland ?
plus , y'know , i think it should be joe .
y'know , joey makes me sound like I am , i dunno , this big .
which I am not .
joe .
joe .
joe .
stalin ?
stalin .
stalin .
do i know that name ?
it sounds familiar .
well , it does not ring a bell with me .
.
.
joe stalin .
y'know , that is pretty good .
might want to try joseph .
joseph stalin .
i think you would remember that !
oh yes !
bye bye birdie , starring joseph stalin .
joseph stalin is the fiddler on the roof .
hey .
hey .
hi .
hi , uh , yes , this is monica geller .
um , i believe I am taking some classes with you and i was wondering what they were .
what are you doing ?
alright , great .
thanks a lot .
I am going to tap class .
what , what , so that you can dance with the woman that stole your credit card ?
this woman's got my life , i should get to see who she is .
go to the post office !
I am sure her picture's up !
.
okay , monica , y'know what , honey , you are kind of losing it here !
i mean , this is really becoming like a weird obsession thing .
this is madness .
it is madness , i tell you , for the love of god , monica , do not do it !
!
.
thank you .
what d'you think ?
lotsa things .
which one do you think she is ?
oh , no thanks , we are just here to observe .
what does she mean ?
i think she means  'you dance a dance class ' .
oh , c'mon , c'mon .
okay , d'y'see anybody you think could be me ?
she could be you .
okay , I am not getting this !
I am totally getting it !
did you ever feel like sometimes you are just so unbelievably uncoordinated ?
what ?
you just click when they click .
okay .
and , my , dead , mother , says , you , are , it .
I am with rachel .
great .
it is gym class all over again .
why do not i just take off my clothes and have a nightmare .
oh .
monica !
.
hi .
I am mo    .
nana .
yeah .
it is dutch .
um , pennsylvania dutch .
hi .
where have you been ?
at the vet .
she is not going to make you wear one of those big plastic cones , is she ?
she says marcel's humping thing's not a phase .
apparently he is reached sexual maturity .
hey !
he beat ya .
she says as time goes on , he is going to start getting agressive and violent .
so what does this mean ?
I am going to have to give him up .
i can not believe it , ross .
this sucks !
i do not get it , i mean , you just got him .
how can he be an adult already ?
i know .
i know .
i mean , one day , he is this little thing , and before you know it , he is this little thing i can not get off my leg .
is not there any way you can keep him ?
no , no .
the vet says unless he is in a place where he has regular access to some .
.
.
monkey lovin , ' he is just going to get vicious .
I have just got to get him into a zoo .
how do you get a monkey into a zoo ?
i know that one !
.

joey's not going .
i did not finish my five pages .
well , why can not you do them tomorrow ?
because tomorrow he is redoing yesterday's pages .
yesterday's pages did not reflect my best work .
why do not you cut him a little slack ?
okay ?
maybe if he relaxes a little bit , he will get some work done .
i think he is been relaxing enough , thanks to you and fireball .
dude , if you think fireball's relaxing , you have obviously have never played .
the only reason you are doing this to joey is because you are bored .
okay , it is not his fault that you are unemployed .
i am not unemployed .
I am on sabbatical !
come on look guys , do not fight .
and the reason I am doing this is because i am joey's friend .
and if you were a good friend , you would be doing the same thing .
oh , so being a good friend means acting like a total jerk ?
if it does ?
then you are an amazing friend of mine .
hey hey guys , hey !

i think he s ready to get rid of , what did you call it ?
the cheap knock offs and dinosaur junk .

!
hey , y know what ?

oh my god !
yeah , like a moth to a flame , i m telling ya .
okay all right , so now you go .

okay .
all right , stand up .
well , when we re at the door , i lightly press my lips against his , and then move into his body just for a second , and then i make this sound , hmmm .

let us begin .
now , the hydrosaurids have been unearthed in two main locations .
here .
here .
now as for the hydrosaurs   okay !
listen , i m going to be moving out so you will be in charge of paying the rent .
right !
and when is that due ?
first of the month .
and that s every month ?
no , just the months you actually want to live here .
ahhh .
okay , here is the phone bill .
oh my god !

that s our phone number .
now look , i know i kind of sprung this whole me moving out on thing , so why don t i just why don t i just cover you for a while ?
no no !
no way !
joey tribbiani does not take charity anymore .
it s not charity , joe  no !
forget it !
okay i mean thanks , but i m done taking money from you .

so is joey going to have to give up the apartment ?
no , i hope not !
i tried to offer him some money , but he wouldn t take it .
well , how much do you think he needs ?
i figure that $1,500 would cover him for a few months , y know ?
but i have to trick him into taking it so i won t hurt his pride .
why don t you hire him as an actor ?
you could have him dress up and put on little skits .
whatever you want .
well that would help the pride thing .
hey !

you look great !
want to move in with me tomorrow ?
okay .

and it should be you , because she s the one who s leaving .
it s harder for her !
well , maybe you re right she made fun of my phone pen !
i know , i took it hard too .
listen rachel , i feel really bad about what are you doing ?
i m unpacking !

!
i m not moving !
is that picture straight ?
it needs to go about 20 blocks to the left !
hey , y know what ?
you re the one who wants to make this big change and move in with chandler !
you should be the one to go !
why should i have to leave ?
!
because it s my apartment !
well it s mine too !

but deep down you re still really sad .
deep deep down .
no phoebe i am mad !
well , deep deep deep down !

that my friend is d cup .
okay , now much have you won so far ?
uh ,  wow , 700 .
not 700 exactly ?
yeah .
double it !
what ?
well you see in cups , once you get $700 , you have to double it .
really ?
hey , i didn t make up the rules .
now , after you receive the doubling bonus , you get uh , one card .
now that one card could be worth $100 bringing your total to 1,500 .
don t get to excited because that s not going to happen unless you get no way !
well , this is the last box of your clothes .
i m just going to label it , what were you thinking ?
funny , because i was just going to go across the hall and write that on chandler .
hey you guys , i don t mean to make things worse , but umm , i don t want to live with rachel anymore .
you re just so mean to each other !
and i don t want to end up like that with rachel .
i still like you !
well , phoebe that s fine because i m not moving .
whoa whoa whoa , phoebe you got to take her !
y know i i i said some really bad stuff about her , but y know rachel has some good qualities that make her a good roommate .
oh really ?
like what monica ?
y know she has 147,000 pairs of boots  oh yeah , good start mon .
she let us you borrow them .
yeah and you stretch  them out with your big old clown feet .
do you want to live outside ?
!
because it s gettin  cold !
she gets tons of catalogs and umm , she ll fold down the pages of the things she thinks that i d like .
what else ?
when i take a shower , she leaves me little notes on the mirror .
yeah , i do .
i i do , do that .
that s nice .
i like having things to read in the bathroom .
when i fall asleep on the couch after reading , she covers me over with a blanket .
well y know , i don t want you to be cold .
and when i told her that i was going to be moving in with chandler , she was really supportive .
you were so great .
you made it so easy .
and now you have to leave .
and i have to live with a boy !
!
oh , it s going to be fine .
okay rachel , i can t wait to live with you !
and you know what we should do ?
bring monica and then we could all live there together !
we ll have so much fun !

i can t take the big white dog !
you love it !
it s him , not it !
no , but wait what if i bought it from you , y know ?
and your nice gesture would be giving it to me at a reasonable price , say  $1,500 ?
wait a second , i see what you re trying to do here !
you you re trying to give me money again !
when did i try to give you money ?
over there !
before , with the bills !

.
.
you are getting ham on my only tie .

.
.
.

look , I am , I am married !
I am *happily * married .
right .
so , I am sorry .
.
.
well look , it is not easy to spend this much time apart , you know .
she is entitled to be a little paranoid .
.
.
or , in this case : right on money !
.
.
.
you know , she is amazing , and beautiful , and smart , and if she were here right now ,  .
she would kick your ass .
look , you are a really nice person .
.
.
ham stealing and adultery aside .
but , what i have with my wife is pretty great , so nothing is ever going to happen between us .
i mean , you were the most beautiful woman in the room tonight !
really ?
you kidding ?
you are the most beautiful woman in most rooms .
.
.
whoa !
whoa !
whoa !
what is going on ?
you and i just made out !
you and i are making out ?
well , not anymore .
but we do not do that .
i know , i just thought it would be fun .
how drunk are you ?
drunk enough that i know i want to do this .
not so drunk that you should feel guilty about taking advantage .
that is the perfect amount !
okay !
y'know what is weird ?
what ?
this does not feel weird !
i know .
you are a really good kisser .
well , i have kissed over four women .
do you want to get under the covers ?
hm hmm !
okay !
wow !
you are really fast !
it bodes well for me that speed impresses you .
we are going to see each other naked .
yep !
do you want to do it at the same time ?
count of three ?
one !
two !
two !
well i think it is safe to say that our friendship is effectively ruined .
eh , we were not that close anyway !
eh !
so , are you really going to go out with that nurse man ?
well uh , you and i are just goofing around , i thought , why not just goof around with him .
y'know , i do not know if you have ever looked up the term goofing around in the dictionary .
.
.
well , i have , and the technical definition is , two friends who care a lot about each other and have amazing sex and just want to spend more time together .
but if you have this new fangled dictionary that gets you made at me , then we have to , y'know , get you my original dictionary .
i am *so * bad at this .
i think you are better than you think you are .
really ?
okay , so .
.
.
know when to stop .
y'know , i sensed that i should stop .
so we are okay ?
yeah .
do not do the dance .
right !
i can not get married until i get something old , something new , something borrowed , and something blue .
okay , all right , all right , all right !
okay !
okay , here is something , here is something blue and new .
you are so efficient .
i love you !
let us go !
no no no , wait !
we need something old !
oh , okay , i have condom in my wallet that I have had since i was twelve .
that will work !
i do not think so .
okay , now we just need something borrowed !
here just .
take this .
that is stealing !
no , we will we will bring it back !
just put it under your dress .
ohh .
okay , one thing at a time .
listen umm , I have been thinking , it is not fair for me to ask you to spend all of your money on our wedding .
i mean , you work , you work really hard for that .
ehh .
eh , you work for that .
look , i thought about it too , and I am sorry .
i think we should spend all of the money on the wedding .
you do ?
!
yeah , I am putting my foot down .
yeah look , when i proposed i told you that i would do anything to make you happy , and if having the perfect wedding makes you happy , then , then that is what we are going to do .
oh , you are so sweet .
oh , but wait , what about our , what about the future and stuff ?
eh , forget about the future and stuff !
so we only have two kids , y'know ?
we will pick our favorite and that one will get to go to college .
you thought about that ?
yeah .
how many kids were we going to have ?
uh , four , a boy , twin girls and another boy .
what else did you think about ?
well , stuff like where we would live , y'know ?
like a small place outside the city , where our kids could learn to ride their bikes and stuff .
y'know , we could have a cat that had a bell on its collar and we could hear it every time it ran through the little kitty door .
of course , we would have an apartment over the garage where joey could grow old .
y'know what ?
i i do not want a big , fancy wedding .
sure you do .
no , i want everything that you just said .
i want a marriage .
you sure ?
uh hmm .
i love you so much .
i love you .

believe me , that is not why we will not be doing that !
you know pheebs , when i was little , on my birthday , my daddy would hide a present in every room of the house , and then he would draw a treasure map to help me find  them all .
oooh , i love family traditions like that .
when uhm .
.
.
when ursula and i were kids , on our birthday , our stepdad would sell his blood to buy us food !
hey guys !
hey , i brought the camera for emma's video .
oh , good , good !
we had this idea to make a birthday video for emma and we will give it to her when she is 18 .
oh , cool !
!
wow , it is like a time capsule !
yeah !
oh , just think .
.
.
she is going to be watching that video on a tv that has not even been invented yet !
with friends who right now are just like babies !
and they will be living in a floating city that the humans built to escape the ant people !
that is the hope !
so , is emma awake yet ?
oh no , it is still nap time .
but she will be up soon .
ah , and where is joey ?
i said it is still nap time .
hey , there is uncle joey !
hey !
hey , say something to emma on her 18th birthday !
18 , uh ?
joey , no !
what , what !
?
it is for her hot friends !
when they see this you will be 52 !
and starting to think about settling down !
hey joey , will you please set this up for people to put emma's presents on ?
I would love to !
yeah !
we were supposed to bring presents ?
yeah !
i wrote emma a song .
oh , yeah !
how was i supposed to know ?
joey , it is a birthday party .
yeah , but for a one year old .
what is the point .
.
.
the other day she laughed for like an hour at a cup .
just a cup with a picture of elmo on it dressed as a farmer .
and he is standing next to this cow and the cow says el moo  !
yeah .
.
.
that is a funny cup !
hey !
hey hey !
where is the birthday girl ?
oh , she is still napping oh , sure , she was probably up all night , excited about the party she knows is happening .
look , i know that you guys really want to get to vermont and this is not a really big deal to you , but it really is to us , ok ?
emma will never have a first birthday again .
all right .
.
.
you are right .
we are sorry .
now let us wake up emma and get the fun time started !
no really , she did not sleep well last night , so we can not wake her up .
are you freaking kidding me , green ?
hey !
so glad you came !
there is something you did not know about your dad !
hey mr .
and mrs .
geller !
let me help you with that .
oh man , this is great , uh ?
the three of us together again !
you know what would be fun ?
if we gave this present to emma from all of us !
i can not believe emma is still asleep !
i know , what are we going to do ?
I have got a plan .
I have got a plan .
I am going to ram this platter really hard into your ribs .
you are going to scream out and that will wake her up !
I am not going to vermont with this monica !
hey pheebs , you know what ?
i was thinking .
.
.
since you wrote a song , maybe i could do something for emma using my talents !
so you re going to .
.
.
hit on her ?
no , no , no !
my talents as an actor !
oh !
you know , i could like maybe .
.
.
i could do a dramatic reading of one of her books !
or you could stick a fork in an apple !
hey , i think emma might like it !
oh !
emma might like what ?
um , my present !
what did you get her ?
actually we prepared performances .
separate performances .
but equally real !
well , this sounds like fun !
well , you know what ?
actually ?
people are getting a little antsy waiting emma to wake up from her nap , so would you mind performing them once now ?
sure , yeah !
of k .
all right , let s get this party started , huh ?
joey and phoebe are going to perform a little something for us .
oh , great !
are you going to be embarrassed going up there having nothing prepared ?
hey , i do it every week with three cameras pointed at me and a whole crew waiting !
so , joey , what are you going to do for us ?
i will be doing a dramatic reading of one of emma s books .
oh , ok , which one ?
uh , why , it s a .
.
.
one of her favorites , uh ,   riding the storm out .
coping with post partum depression  eesh !
love you forever  .
love you forever .
by robert munsch .
published by firefly books .
printed  in mexico .
a mother held her new baby and very slowly rocked him back and forth , back and forth , back and forth , and while she held him she sang  i ll love you forever , i ll like you for always , as long as I am living , my baby you ll be  .
.
and while he rocked her , he sang  i ll love you forever , i ll like you for always , as long as I am living , my baby you ll be  .
wow !
that was amazing !
thank you so much for that gift !
amazing .
.
.
amazing .
oh , phoebe , i m sorry !
phoebe has prepared something as well .
that s right , I have prepared a song for emma .
from my heart to hers .
for there s no greater gift , than the gift of music .
emma !
your name poses a dilemma .
because not much else rhymes with emma !
maybe the actor richard crenna , he played the commanding officer in rambo .
happy birthday emma !
is that it ?
no , of course not !
i also , you know , prepared a reading  .
sex and the single mother .
finding your g spot .
ross , um , don t forget to get a shot of emma s cake .
it s in a box in the fridge .
sure .
oh , you are going to love this cake .
i got it from a bakery in new jersey , corino s .
oh my god , that place has the creamiest frosting !
i use to hitchhike there when i was a kid .
well , anyway , they make these great novelty cakes , in all different shapes , and if you give them a photo , they ll copy it in icing !
oh , did you do a picture of emma ?
yes !
on a cake shaped like a bunny .
uh , rach ?
does this bakery by any chance also bake erotic cakes ?
say for bachelorette parties ?
ross , what are you talking about ?
oh !
oh my god !
they put my baby s face on a penis !
why you guys this is not funny , all right ?
if i wanted this cake to be a disaster i would have baked it myself !
i am this close to tugging on my testicles again .
ask them if it would be faster if we cut the baby s face off the penis , so we can put it on the bunny .
.
that is a weird sentence !
oh !
believe you me !
i am going to bring this cake back , i do not even want it in my home .
.
.
joey , do not touch it !
!
I am so confused !
yes , yes .
i still want my daughters picture , but on a bunny cake .
yellow cake , chocolate frosting with nuts !
to be fair this one does have nuts .
hey mon , that was really nice of you to loan rachel your car so she could go and get the cake .
oh .
so nice of her to pull my hair , 'till i dropped the key !
well , you know what ?
while we are waiting , you guys could tape your message to emma for her 18th birthday , huh ?
ok !
hi emma !
it is the year 2020 .
are you still enjoying your nap ?
we are aunt monica and uncle chandler , by the way .
you may not recognize us , because we have not spoken to your parents in seventeen years !
we used to be married , but then we missed a weekend away together and things kind of unraveled .
because of you !
happy birthday .
ross , rachel promised it would be over by now .
we seriously have to go , if we want to get to vermont .
i called them and the last train leaves in a half hour .
and you know , i have a massage client soon .
you guys , just please .
.
a little bit longer .
i promise , rachel will be back with the cake any minute .
monica , remember .
.
the frosting ?
huh ?
alright , 5 more minutes .
hello ?
oh no !
what happened ?
ok ok , where are you ?
.
ok , I will be right there .

no , rachel got pulled over for speeding .
she forgot her licence so now i have to bring it to her .

no !
wait !
if anybody gets to go .
.
it is us  we have been complaining the longest !
no , wait  !

rachel already feels bad that the cake's messed up .
how do you think she is going to feel when she comes back here and all you guys are gone ?
i do not know !

hey , hey , hey , hey !
I am not going to mess with jack , he is a great man , he fought for our country .
no , he did not !
he pretended to be a quaker to get out of korea .
oh !
well that is it !
he is the last one to go .
I am locking you guys in .
you do know , i can just turn them the other way around , right ?
oh !

well , oh , ok now .
.
.
only one of us has to stay with emma .
ok , and as the person who realized that , i get to go !
no !
no !
let us figure out a fair way to decide who is staying .
oh !
i got it !
ok , everyone pick a number from one to ten .
alright ?
whoever gets the highest number gets to go first .
ok , ten .
okay , monica picks ten , i call nine !
anyone else ?
no , let us just draw straws .
or .
.
we could flip a coin , and then multiply the .
.
I am begging you stop .
right .
ok , how about this : we got wind up toys for emma for her birthday .
we can make them race , and whoever comes in last , stays !
yeah !
!
let us do that !
that sounds more fun than the thing we were going to do in vermont !
everybody get your toys !
ok !
i want the dolphin !
that is a bear .
I am too excited !
phoebe , you get the bear , uhm , joey , you get the robot , and chandler and i get the dog .
ok , and the race is going to go  from here to here .
now the one who comes in last , stays !
ok , ladies and gentlemen , wind your toys !

good job alan !
hey , good race you guys .
yeah , see you later !
no !
no , no .
.

wait !
we did not lose .
the rules clearly stated that the last one to cross the finish line was the loser .
well , our dog never crossed the finish line , so technically .
.
.
they left .
no , there is not time to go to the bakery .
we are just going to come home .
.
.
everybody left ?
alright , well just tell emma we are going to be there as soon as we can .

rachel !
ooh !
god !
sorry !
i can not believe they gave you a ticket .
you are such a good driver .
emma's awake .
yeah ?
i can not believe this .
this is her first birthday .
she is awake .
we are not even there .
everybody left .
we still have this stupid obscene cake .
hey , maybe i can fix that , you know .
try to turn it into something else .
oh , why do you even bother ?
i already ruined her first birthday .
.
.
and do you know how important these early experiences are ross ?
very !
according to the back cover of that book that you gave me .
rach , she is not going to remember this .
i guess .
.
.
oh , i just had such an idea of what this day would be like , you know ?
emma laughing and everybody gathered around her cake singing happy birthday  .
then we would all go into .
.
.
hey get out of the road you stupid student driver !
!
!
they have to learn !
hey !
what ?
it is not bad .
oh my god !
look what .
.
.
you made it into a bunny .
how did you do that ?
well , i just made these two things uhm .
.
.
cheeks .
and then i split this to make ears .
well , I am very impressed .
some can sing , some can dance .
i apparently can turn phallic cakes into woodland creatures .
now another way to organise your stuffed animals , is by size .
I am sorry , is this a game for emma or for monica ?
game ?
emma , you even know it is your birthday today ?
you are one !
one year old , that is little .
ooh !
that is my girl !
that is how old you are .
did i teach her that ?
did i just .
.
.
impart wisdom ?
ooh , i want one .
.
.
me too .
.
.
there is no one around .
why do not we just take this one ?
.
and head to canada !
i was kidding .
i was not .
let us get going !
hey , are ross and rachel back ?
no , not yet .
oh good , i did not miss the party .
what about your massage client ?
i just felt so bad , missing this .
so i just slipped him a little something , you know .
as long as I am back in five or six hours , it will be alright .
okay , if ross and rachel ask , I have been here the whole time .
the whole time !
I have been here the whole time !

he took up the carpet , and now you can hear everything .
why don t you go up there and ask him to  step lightly , please ?
i have like five times , but the guy is so charming , that i go up there to yell and then i end up apologizing to him .

good luck .
all right , all right , all right , all right , all right , you really want to know how i did it , i ll show ya .

yeah , look i was with my friend downstairs and we hear everything up here that you do , and i am sick and tired .

to be nice .
hey , joey .
are men ever nice to strange women for no reason ?
no , only for sex .

yeah .
i never had a bike of my own .
what ?
!
well , we didn t have a lot of money .
but the girl across the street had the best bike !
it was pink and it had rainbow colored tassels hanging off the handle grips , and and and a bell and this big , white wicker basket with those plastic daisies stuck on .
that sounds like my first bike .
my dad gave me his old one .
ohh .
did the girl ever let you ride it ?
no !
but she gave me the box that it came in .
it had a picture of the bike on the front .
so i would sit on it and my step dad would drag me around the backyard .
that is so unfair !
not really , i got to drag him around too !
hey !
what are you guys doing ?
hey .
making holiday candy for the neighbors .
i m sorry , who ?
i m going to hang this basket  on the door and when the neighbors walk by they can all take a piece .
but we don t know the neighbors .
i do .
there s uh , let s see , guy with a mustache , smokes a lot lady , some kids i ve seen , and a red haired guy who does not like to be called rusty .

what happened ?
i m just eating candy .
maybe it s not as bad as i think .

phoebe , you can t get out of this !
okay ?
you have to learn how to ride a bike !
why ?
why do i have to learn ?
well in in case of emergency .
what kind of an emergency ?
well let there what if a man comes along and puts a gun to your head and says , you ride this bike or i ll sh i ll shoot you .

except for that time when we bumped into each other at that strip club .
strip church .
anyway , I am going to go try and find a racquet .

i told you how I am on sabbatical from work , right ?
oh  this is not what i ordered !
man !
can anything go right in my life ?
!
first my marriage falls apart and then  okay .
sometimes i feel  huh ?
let let me make sure I am hearing this right , you are ending this with me because I am too whiney ?
so you are saying , I have become so whiney that i annoy you , janice .

dude , we got to talk .
okay .
i just wanted to tell you something before you heard it from someone else and i hope this is not too weird , but uh , i had uh , a thing with janice .
what you are you are not mad ?
why would i be mad ?
well , because y'know there are certain rules about this kind of stuff .
you do not uh , you do not fool around with your uh , friend's ex girlfriends or possible girlfriends or girls they are related to .
i am mad !
but you know what I am going to do ?
I am going to forgive you !
because that is what friends do !
they forgive their friends when they do everything you just said , all on the list there .
well , but i want you to remember that i forgave you .
okay .
i also want you to remember that i let you live here rent free !
all right .
and , i want you to remember that i gave you twenty  seven dollars .
no strings attached .
now , if you can not remember that , i think we should write it down let us write it down !
pheebs , can you help me pick out an engagement ring for monica ?
i can t figure this out !
it s so hard !
should i get her a  tiffany cut or a princess cut or a ah ah !
paper cut !
now , have you told anyone else ?
no , i don t want to tell anybody else because i don t want monica to find out .
you told me .
well , it s because i trust you , you re one of my best friends , and you walked in on me when i was looking at ring brochures .
yeah well , once again not knocking pays off .
i only wish you hadn t been on the toilet .
me too .
hey .
hey .

how rude .
oh , i m sorry .
you want to bite ?
so how are things going with paul ?
good .
although y know , he he s a private guy .
y know , i wish i could get him to open up a little bit , share some feelings .
that s easy !
you just have to think of him as a as a jar of pickles that won t open .
so what are you saying ; i should run him under hot water and bang his head against a table ?
no that s what you do when you want to get the truth out of someone .
hi !
watch this .
okay .

i can t think of anything .
come on ross , you re a paleontologist , dig a little deeper .
wait a minute , is it because joey and i didn t invite him to that knicks game a couple of weeks ago ?
do you think that s something that he d be mad at you for ?
i guess it could .
well then i think that s it .
well , if he s angry , he really shouldn t just cover it up .
i i wish he would just tell me the truth .
oh , if that s what you want you then you really should run his head under hot water and bang his head against a table .
yeah that s great .
but first , wait , talk to me , talk to me .
tell me about your day .
okay .
hey , what are you thinking ?
what are you thinking right now ?
yeah that s great paul , but y know i want to know what wow , those are really great !
i just want to know what , what is behind this this strong , silent exterior .
y know they say that still waters run deep and i want to swim in yours .
no paul , i don t know anything about you !
y know , like like your childhood !
tell me about your childhood !
okay , well then how about puberty !
come on , that s always a painful time !
y know your friends invite you to a slumber party and then they stick your hand in warm water while you re sleeping so that you pee in your sleeping bag .

phoebe , i asked you to guard the ring !
i know , i m sorry !

monica never even saw the other ring .

he blew us off !
what ?
!
i know !
i can t believe it .
can i tell you something ?
i m a little mad at him now .

y know , i got to tell ya writing , i mean writing , gets me uh , gets me kind of hot .
a lover ?
oh yeah surfer ?
okay , hold on real quick , hold on a second let me just uh ,  get a little more comfortable here .
wait , now wait a second , this isn t too revealing is it ?
i don t care about the little dude !
i can t !
i cannot listen to anymore of this !
y know , the only person who would want to listen to this is a mental health professional !
and then it s only because they get paid $100 an hour !
do you know how much money i could ve made listening to you ?
$2,000 !
and do you know when i figured that out ?
while you were talking !
oh  i m sorry .
i  i i don t mean i didn t mean to stifle you .
i  this is all just a little overwhelming .
i m so glad , i m so glad you shared .
and i m glad that you re done .
what do you say we umm    hey .
i can t believe i let you talk me into buying this stupid gumball machine looking ring !
it s not a stupid gumball machine looking ring !
it s a beautiful ring !
no , it s not !
when i looked at the other ring i could see monica s face when i gave it to her , y know ?
and i could see her saying yes .
when i look at this ring , all i see is a ring !
unless i look at it really closely and then i can see my own eye .
look , this is the most important thing i m going to do in my life .
i want to make sure it s perfect .
okay .
there may be a way that we can get the other ring back .
because i heard the guy tell the jeweler where he was going to propose .
so maybe we can get him to trade rings or something .
i can t do that .
well you certainly can t give her that stupid gumball ring .
there he is !
okay and he hasn t proposed yet because she has no ring on her finger .
wow !
you re good !
after this , we should solve crimes .
yeah !
okay , go , go , go get him .
oh , okay .
excuse me sir ?
could you come with me please ?
you have a phone call .
it is your office .
john ?
here he is .
hi !
hi .
okay , there was a slight mix up at the jewelry store , the ring you re about to propose with was supposed to be held for me .
so , i m going to need to have that back .
but , in exchange i m willing to trade you this beautiful , more expensive ring .
ew .
wow !
i would trade .
no no !
this is my fiancee  and her heart was set on that ring .
you don t want to break her heart now do you ?
yeah , do you want to break a dying woman s heart ?
yeah , she s dying  of a cough apparently .
yes , and it is my dying wish to have that ring .
see , if i m not buried with that ring then my spirit is going to wander the nether world for all eternity   okay , that s enough honey !
great !
okay , here .
thank you .

rachel came over to borrow something .
anyway !
her and ross just started yelling at each other .

why was he yelling at her ?
he s the one who slept with someone else .
well , i guess he says that because they were on a break when it happened , that she should of forgiven him by now .
whoa !
!
he is soo unreasonable !
god , although i think i understand what he means .
oh my god , this is like 60 minutes , okay , when , when , at first you re really mad at that pharmaceutical company for making the drug and then y'know you just feel bad for the people because they needed to make their hair grow .
y'know what this is like ?
this is like when my parents got divorced .
man , i hope ross doesn t try to kidnap me after cub scouts .
y'know i had a dream where ross and rachel were still together , they never broke up .
and we were all just like hanging out , and everyone was happy .

did you tell the doctor you did it jumping up and down on your bed ?
nooo .
i had a story all worked out but then chandler sold me out .
well , I am sorry joe .
i did not think the doctor was going to buy that it just *fell * out of the socket .
what is this ?
fruit ?
monica's making jam .
whoa , jam !
i love jam !
hey , how come we never have jam at our place ?
because the kids need new shoes .
I am going into business people .
I am sick and tired of being depressed about richard .
i needed a plan , a plan to get over my man .
what is the opposite of man ?
jam .
oh joey do not !
it is way to hot .
this will just be my batch .
um , that is it .
no .
hey !
you !
j .
crew guy .
yeah .
why have you been following me ?
i mean , all week long everywhere i look there is you .
what ?
oooh .
oh , well this is awkward .
um , yeah , you want ursula , and I am phoebe .
twin sisters !
seriously .
oh , you are not a dingus .
well , i mean look it is , it is not your fault , you know .
i mean this is just what , what she does to guys , okay .
wait ,  you know what , i got a little story .
when i was in junior high school i went through this period where i thought i was a witch .
and there was this guidance counselor who said something to me , that i think will help you a lot .
he said okay , 'you are not a witch you are just an average student . '
see what I am saying ?
um , well , get over it .
so , i mean you , you just seem to be a really nice guy , you know .
do not be so hard on yourself okay .
oh , thanks a lot .
do you want to get a cup of coffee ?
okay .
okay , you do not have to walk behind me any more .
mon ?
mon ?
'gone for more jars .
back later .
monica geller . '
wait a minute , look .
what ?
look , look , look .
what , what , what ?
it is an empty apartment .
oooh .
we are all alone in an empty apartment .
honey , come on , i have to be at work in like ten minutes  oh , all right , well it is not like I am employee of the year or anything .
there it is .
oh , oh , that is what you are talking about .
hey .
hey .
do i look fat ?
okay , i accept that .
when janice asked me and i said no , she took that to mean that i was calling her a cow .
okay , walk us through it , honey , walk us through it .
okay , well .
janice said 'hi , do i look fat today ? '
and i , i looked at her .
.
.
.
whoa , whoa , whoa .
you looked at her .
you never look .
you just answer , it is just a reflex .
do i look fat ?
nooo !
is she prettier than i am ?
noo !
does size matter ?
nooo !
and it works both ways .
okay , so you both just know this stuff ?
well you know , after about thirty or forty fights , you kind of catch on .
okay , for instance .
let us say , janice is coming back from a trip and she gives you two options .
option number 1 she will take a cab home from the airport .
option 2 is you can meet her at baggage claim .
which do you do ?
that is easy , baggage claim .
wrong !
now you are single .
it is actually secret option number three , you meet her at the gate .
that way she knows you love her .
okay , this is good , this is good .
all right listen , i have one .
janice likes to cuddle , at night , which , you know I am all for .
but , uh , you know when you want to go to sleep , you want some space .
so , uh , how do i tell her that without , you know , accidentally calling her fat or something .
oh honey , I am sorry we can not help you there , because we are cuddlily sleepers .
okay , I am late for work .
oh .
all right are you guys going to come down ?
uh , yeah , yeah I will , I am right behind you .
good luck chandler .
thank you rachel .
bye sweetie .
bye hon .
okay the sleeping thing .
very tricky business , but there is something you can do .
well , i thought you guys were cuddlily sleepers .
noo !
no , not cuddlily , not me , just her .
I am like you , i need the room .
okay , come here .
okay , you are in bed .
.
.
yeah .
I am going to use the cushion .
yeah .
okay , you are in bed .
she is over on your side , cuddling .
now you wait for her to drift off , and then you hug her  and roll her back over to her side of the bed .
and then you rollll a way .
hug for her !
roll for you .
okay , the old hug and roll .
yep .
okay , one question .
shoot .
you are pretending the pillow's a girl right ?
remember when you where a kid and your mom would drop you off at the movies with a jar of jam and a little spoon ?
you are so pretty .
hi !
hey , oh , you know that guy who is been following me ?
i talked to him today .
you talked to him .
are you crazy ?
okay , first I am not crazy .
and second , say it do not spray it .
anyway his name is malcom , and he was not following me , i mean he was , but because he thought i was ursula , ick .
and , that is why , that is why he could not just come up and talk to me .
because of the restraining order .
umm , not feeling better 'bout malcom .
ooh !
no , no , no , no , he is not like a kook , no .
he is just like this , this very passionate , incredibly romantic guy , that got like a tinsy bit carried away , you know .
and we just get along really well , and he is so cute .
oh my god , you have got a crush on your sister's stalker .
no , I am just going to help him , you know , get 'de ursula ized ' , like you know , like i did for joey after he went out with her .
hey , i did not stalk her .
i mean  okay , i asked for the news , not the weather .
hey guys .
joey , this is for you .
it is blackberry curin .
aww .
ohh !
hey , joe , i got to ask .
the girl from the xerox place buck naked  , or , or a big tub of jam .
put your hands together .
joey , take your time with that .
that is my last batch .
no more jam ?
!
well , what happened to your jam plan ?
i figured out i need to charge seventeen bucks a jar just to break even .
so , I have got a new plan now .
babies .
well , your going to need much bigger jars .
what are you talking about ?
I am talking about me having a baby .
what ?
are you serious ?
yeah .
the great thing about the jam plan was , i was taking control of my life .
so i asked myself , what is the most important thing to me in the world and that is when i came up with the baby plan .
well , are not you forgetin ' something ?
what , what , what is uh , what is that guy's name ?
dad !
it took me 28 years to find one man that i want to spend my life with , if i have to wait another 28 years then , I will be 56 before i can have a baby , and that is just stupid .
that , that is what is stupid .
i do not need an actual man , just a couple of his best swimmers .
and there , there are places you can go to get that stuff .
down at the docks again ?
night night .
.
.
janice .
'look at all that room on her side , you good fit a giant penguin over there .
that would be weird though .
okay , hug and roll time .
I am huggin ' , I am huggin ' , your rollin ' , and .

pheebs , wake up and smell the restraining order .

i know , i know , but look at the knobs on her .
hey !
emily's cousin kicked me out !

who needs a lease when it is family !
hey , you can stay with us !

uh , look , larry honey , umm , i wrote the book on section 5 and i know that you do not have to wear your hat unless you are in the kitchen .
it is in the kitchen , I will go get it .
hey , you should really read that book you wrote .
wow !
you saw the hat in the kitchen and knew that she would have to go in there hatless to get it .
you can have your own health inspector detective show !
yeah , but then i can be you sidekick vunda .
okay , she would love that !
y'know , because you know all the clean places to eat .
okay .
he is so funny !
thanks .
thank you .
mon ?
hmm ?
how is ross doing ?
y'know since all the emily stuff .
he is not great umm , but he is dealing with it .
oh wait a minute , you are not going to try  oh , honey , please , no , i can not get started with all that ross stuff again .
i mean , he is going to screwed up for a looong time .
and besides y'know , i do not , i do not go for guys right after they get divorced .
right , you only go for them 5 minutes before they get married .
danny .
are you guys ever going to go out again ?
i do not know !

thirsty huh ?
ohh , fun !
ohh , great !
yeah .
well , i guess we will not be warming his house .
okay .
all right , i see what he is doing !
he is not asking me out , because he wants me to ask him out .
and you are not going to do that .
that is right !
because that would give him the control !
so now he is all ooh , coming up with this whole I have got a party thing y'know , trying to get me to hint around for an invitation .
blew up in his face , did not it ?
so so there is no party .

exactly .
ross ?
hey roomies !

oh , yeah i know , i know , it is a lot of boxes , but again i really appreciate you guys letting me stay here .

no , i think we are just blurry shapes to him now .
oh , ha , i wrote that in one minute .
twenty bucks says they are married within the month .
we should probably get going , you know , we got a lot of ground to cover .
i do not think so .
oh , well he is obviously late and the rule in my class is if you can not come on time , then do not come at all  .
an option that many of my students use .

i mean , you went out with a guy who improved the accuracy of radiocarbon dating by a factor of 10 !
oh !
like what ?
!
oh I am sorry , i do not mean to pry .
.
.
it is just that this must be what regular people experience when they watch access hollywood  .
who is intimidating to a guy who won the nobel prize ?
two ?
wha .
.
.
?
do not tell me you dated benjamin hobart oh my god !
have you ever been in a relationship with someone who has not won the nobel prize ?
oh yeah ?

huh .
.
.
huh .
.
.
what a loser !
some more wine ?
hey ross !
oh great !
after i finish my wine I am going to blow my .
.
.
eh .
average sized brains out .
oh , what is the matter ?
she .
.
.
she only dates geniuses and nobel prize winners .
oh my god , at the chinese restaurant earlier today , i put chopsticks in my mouth and pretented to be a woolly mammoth .
i always loved that !
!
of course you would , your brains are smaller than mine !
!
man , i can not compete with the guys she goes out with , they are so out of my league !
oh my god !
worse ?
oh much , much worse .
i did my impression of joan rivers as one of the earliest amphibians .
.
.
can we walk  ?
oh , you .
.
.
you like that ?
no .
what ?
come on !
i think this is funny !
oh yes , god yes !

i .
.
.
i do not know .
.
.
you seem lovely .
hey ross , this is one of my co stars , dirk .
dirk , this is my good friend ross .
nice to meet you .
oh , I am no actor , I am a professor of palaeontology .
it is a science .
hey ross , listen , dirk was wondering about the woman that you brought and if you guys were together , or .
.
.
oh , well no , but i mean , she only goes out with really , really smart guys .
I would lead with that .
that is it , just sign right on the bra  .
monica !
do not worry joe , i will not come next year !
what have you got there ?
just some boys gave me their phone numbers .
ah , let me see !
damn , that is a lot of guys !
are you a little slutty ?
i think i am .
let me see if i approve any of these clowns .
this guy wears a rug  .
this guy's canadian  .
and this guy is in a cult , ok , and it costs you 5,000 $ to get to level three and i do not feel any different .
pass , pass , oh , pass , double pass , pass .
.
.
why , why , what is wrong with these guys ?
nothing major , it is just that , you know , they are not really good enough for you , and you deserve the best .
joey , you are so sweet .
that is true .
but you know what , it does not matter because i already know who you are going to go home with tonight .
who  ?
me .
what ?
really ?
yes , because we live together , that is a joke !
oh !
screw it , i did not get it !
gotcha .
oh , very funny .
.
.
joey .
so , how did you enjoy the play ?
oh my god , honey , I am so so so so so sorry .
well you should be .
you missed the most powerful three hours in the history of the theater .
you really liked it ?
oh yeah !
i mean at first i hated it , but why would not i , because as a man I have been trained  not to listen !
but after chapter 16 : fat , single and ready to mingle  , i was uplifted .
oh really !
oh yeah , i had no idea the amazing journey you go through as a woman !
tell me , tell me about your first period !
no !
did somebody sign your bra ?
so i got it when i was 13 .
.
.
hey ross !
so listen , about you and the dinosaur girl , are you really just going to let a couple of nobel prizes scare you off ?
what is that , come on , a piece of paper ?
it is actually a 1,000,000 $ prize .
go charlie !
but my point is , ok so she dated them but she also broke up with them .
maybe she is looking to , you know , slum it with some average joe phd .
yeah , maybe .
i do have my whole career in front of me .
i mean , i can still win a nobel prize .
although the last two papers I have written were widely discredited .
you are so much more than just brains !
you are sweet , and kind , and funny .
.
.
and sexy .
ok well give her a chance to see all of that !
yeah , you are right , thanks pheebs , I am going to go find her .
good for you !
and hey , i thought your paper on punctuated equilibrium in the devonian era was top notch !
stop going through my stuff  !
hey !
hey !
i just wanted to let you know I have changed my mind : I am going to do it , I am going to kiss joey .
no , you can not !
friends hooking up is a bad idea .
please , what about you and chandler ?
that is different !
i was drunk and stupid !
well hello  !
what about all the guys that you have got the phone numbers from ?
why do not you just kiss one of them ?
i could , i could but i do not want to !
i want to kiss joey !
alright  .
i think it is a big mistake but it is your decision .
I am going to do it .
and i can not stop you .
no .
hey rach , have you seen charlie anywhere ?
I am smarter than him !
hey , thank you so much for these tickets , chandler .
oh well , this was a really important experience for me , and i wanted to share it with you .
oh , you are so wonderful .
can not believe you guys bought that , enjoy your slow death  .
okay , great !
bye .
so guess who s coming to thanksgiving dinner ?
sydney portier ?
hehheh .
i miss rachel .
no , my parents .
oh !
that s great , they haven t seen the place since i moved in !
yeah , and y know , if you could not mention to them that we live together , that would be great !
, i was thinking we would eat around four .
why can t i tell them that we live together ?
because they don t know we re dating .
do you think we should eat in the kitchen ?
why haven t you told them ?
!
um , well , i was going to , i i i really was .
but um , then somewhere , just out of nowhere , i didn t .
why haven t you told them ?
!
wouldn t they be happy ?
!
so !
dinner in the kitchen around four !
i ll see you then .
why wouldn t they be happy ?
well , um , because mainly , um , they don t like you .
i m sorry .
what ?
what ?
why ?
!
maybe because you used to be aloof , or that you re really sarcastic , or that , y know , you joke around all the time .
or that you take off your clothes and throw them on the couch .
is this why they don t like me or why you don t like me ?
look , i know that i should ve told them .
i know i shouldn t care what they think .
i m sorry .
y know , it ll be okay .
it ll be okay .
because when they come over , i will be all charming , i will make them fall in love with me , and then we ll tell  them .
you really think that ll work ?
hey , i can be pretty charming , babe , i won you over , didn t i ?
i don t think you ll ever get my parents that drunk !
hey !
oh , good , ross !
you re parents like me , right ?
yes , of course they like you !
well monica just told me that they don t .
yeah , they don t like you .
do you know why ?
i dunno , maybe it s because you re really sarcastic .
or maybe it s because you uh    well if people don t know they shouldn t just guess !
this is great , another thanksgiving with nothing to give thanks for .
maybe i could give thanks for you shuttin  up , eh ?
maybe i could give thanks by taking my playstation over to my new apartment .

dad [kisses jack ] , mom [kisses judy ] .

y know to me he ll always be  jack geller , walks in while you re changing .
y know dad , chandler is one of ross s very best friends !

he s the headliner of a gay burlesque show .
rach , you re killin  us here , will ya serve the dessert already ?
those drunken dancers are waiting !
look at it , isn t it beautiful ?
yeah , yeah , what is it ?
it s a truffle .
it s got all of these layers .
first there s a layer of ladyfingers , then a layer of jam , then custard , which i made from scratch , [joey and ross make impressed faces ] then raspberries , more ladyfingers , then beef sauteed with peas and onions , [joey and ross look like something s wrong . ]
then a little more custard , and then bananas , and then i just put some whipped cream on top !
w what was the one right before bananas ?
the beef ?
yeah , that was weird to me , too .
but then , y know , i thought  well , there s mincemeat pie ,  i mean that s an english dessert , these people just put very strange things in their food , y know .
[to joey ] oh !

y sure !
and while i m gone don t you boys sneak a taste .
beef in a dessert ?

oh my god , the pages are stuck together !
chandler !
oh my god , she she made half a english trifle , and half a .
sheperd s pie !

what ?
dude , i need to talk to you a sec .
okay , i think i might know why my parents don t like you .

!
why did you do that ?
i don t know , aheh , your s was the first name that that popped into my head , i m i m sorry .
i i didn t think it would matter .
how could it not matter ?
!
how was i supposed to know we d end up being friends after college , let alone you you would be living with my sister ?
what about all that  friends forever  stuff ?
i don t know , i i was all high .
mom and dad just sent me in here to find out if you  were trying to get ross stoned !
your parents caught ross smoking pot in college and he blamed it on me !
ross , i can t believe you d do that !
the reason we haven t told them we re together is because they hate me , okay ?
so will you fix this ?
okay , okay , i ll tell  them it wasn t chandler who got high .
now who should i say it was ?
you !
it s not like it s a big deal !
you you don t still do it or anything !

dad , please don t pick your teeth out here !

will you hurry up ?
did you not hear me before when i told you that all of janine s friends are dancers ?

no , i did , but tell me again , because it s so romantic .
well you re whippin  so slow !
can t you do it any faster ?
joey !
come on !
i don t want to make any mistakes , alright ?
this is the only dessert and if i screw it up everybody's going to be like  oh , remember that thanksgiving when rachel screwed up the trifle ?
so why don t you just let me worry about making the trifle and you just worry about eating it , alright ?
oh i am !
ross , if you don t tell them , then i will !
okay , fine !
ross !
can i talk to you for a second ?
oh , uh , can it wait a second joey ?

the holiday season is upon us , hm ?
yeah !
and um .
you look nice today .
oh no .
no ross , don t do this .
what ?
i just   i don t think us getting back together is a good idea .
eh ?
i thought this might happen today .
ross , i know the holidays can be rough .
y know ?
and it s probably really hard for you to be alone right now .
you re alone .
no , i i live with phoebe .
i mean you re [pity tone ] alone , alone .
and i just it s just not the time for us .
i m sorry .
ah well , can t blame a guy for trying !
oh and  okay , and uh if anyone needs help pretending to like it , i learned something in acting class , try uh , rubbing your stomach  or uh , or saying  mmm  and uh , oh oh !
and smiling  , okay ?
yeah , i m not going to pay for those acting classes anymore .
rachel , there you are !
come on , let s serve that dessert already !
joey , you re going to have to stop rushing me , you know what ?
you don t get any dessert .
really ?
no , i m just kidding i would never do that to you !
okay , everybody , it s trifle time !
so , now , rach , this is a traditional english trifle , isn t it ?
it sure is .
wow .
so then did you make it with beef or eggplant ?
beef .
i can t have any .
you know i don t eat meat .
ohhh no .
alright , monica , i want you to have the first taste .
really ?
oh oh oh , wait !
you only got whipped cream in there !
ya got to take a bite with all the layers !
okay .
op !
wait , you dropped a pea .
well ?
mmmm !
it s good !
really ?
how good ?
it s so good , that i feel really selfish about being the only one who s eating it , that i think we should have everyone taste how good it is .
especially ross .
yeah , this is so good , that i m going to go enjoy it on the balcony so that i can enjoy the view whilst i enjoy my dessert .
i m going to go into the bathroom so i can look at it in the mirror , as i eat it .
okay , now what was that all about ?
is it does it not taste good ?
let me try it .
wha ?
no no !
ah !
all gone !
so good !
maybe chandler has some left .
it tastes like feet !
i like it .
are you kidding ?
what s not to like ?
custard ?
good .
jam ?
good .
meat ?
gooooood .
.
so a bird just grabbed it , and then tried to fly away with it and , and then just dropped it on the street ?
yes , but if it s any consolation , before the bird dropped it , he seemed to enjoy it .
rachel , come here .
okay , i was just starting to take my thanksgiving nap , and i had another dream about jack .
oh , phoebe , do i want to hear this ?
i dunno , let s see !
so , okay , i dreamt that we were going to get married , and he left , becuz he had to go fight a fire .
and , um , so okay , i went to a night club , and i saw him making out with a girl .
oh my god , he dream cheated on you !
yeah , but then jacques cousteau came and he kicked his ass for betraying me !
it was soo cool !
then , he took me diving and he introduced me to his pet seahorse , who , by the way , was totally coming on to me , and please , that is not going to happen .
five minutes ago , a line like that would ve floored me .
now nothing .
well , not nothing , i am still a woman .
ross ?
let s go .
oh yeah , about telling mom and dad , i was thinking about maybe writing a letter .
alright , you know what ?
that s it .
you ve had your chance .
wha what ?
mom !
dad !
ross smoked pot in college !
you are such a tattletale !
mom , dad , you remember that that time you walked in my room and smelled marijuana ?
well i told you it was chandler who was smoking the pot but it was me .
i m sorry .
and dad , y know that mailman that you got fired ?
he didn t steal your playboys !
ross did !
yeah , well , hurricane gloria didn t break the porch swing , monica did !
ross hasn t worked at the museum for a year !
monica and chandler are living together !
ross married rachel in vegas !
and got divorced !
again !
!
!
!
i love jacques cousteau !
i wasn t supposed to put beef in the trifle !
i want to gooooooo !
i i uh , i got tricked into all those things !
thank you !
i ll talk to them !
you guys !
it was bananas , cream , and beef !
i i just cannot believe that you ate that so that i wouldn t feel bad !
well actually , i i didn t eat mine .
it s still in the bathroom .
no it isn t , i ate that .
nope , got it and i got yours  too .
hey !
hey !
hey !
hey !
!
none of that , not while you are living under my roof !
what ?
!
look , just because i know about you two , does not mean i like looking at it .
are not you supposed to be at an audition for another hour ?
well , I am sorry if I am not a middle aged black woman !
and I am also sorry if sometimes i go to the wrong audition !
okay , look , if i have to pretend i do not know about you two , then you two are going to have to pretend there is nothing to know about .
sorry .
sorry .
i can hear that !
rachel's at work .
i can still hear you !
hey !
hey !
hello !
hey , what is that ?
yeah , my mom sent me a family heirloom that once belonged to my grandmother .
can you believe it ?
!
a year ago i did not even have a family , and now i have heirlooms for crying out loud .
eeeee   ohh !
!
god !
argh argh !
!
ooh , soft .
is this mink ?
yeah !
why would my mother send me a fur ?
does not she know me but at all !
plus , i have a perfectly fine coat that no innocent animal suffered to make !
yeah , just some 9 year old filipino kids who worked their fingers bloody for 12 cents an hour .
that did not happen , i made that up !
hey !
how come ?
everybody else does .
what is that ?
oh , umm , I am just getting rid of a couple of things .
this is all of your things .
yes , yes it is !
no , but it is good it is emily thinks we should get all new stuff .
stuff that is just ours , together .
y'know brand new .
so basically , this is a getting rid of everything rachel ever used sale .
touched .
used .
sat on .
sleep on .
hey , ross , you are okay with that ?
look , if i can just do what emily wants and get her to new york , I am sure everything will be fine .
okay , but do not you think this is a little extreme ?
after what i did ?
can you blame her ?
oh my god !
you got off easy !
when my friend silvie's husband said someone else's name in bed , she cursed him and turned his thingy green .
what is he doing ?
what , emily , thinks ross's furniture has got rachel coodies ?
now calm down joey .
no !
everything's gettin ' all messed up , y'know ?
emily will not let ross see rachel , we are not going to stop seeing rachel , hence ross stops seeing us !
oh , i hate this .
everything's changing .
yeah i know , we are losing ross , joey said hence  look , I am not happy about this either , but y'know if if ross says he is happy then we are just going to have to keep our feelings about emily to ourselves .
are you cool with that ?
no !
but y'know , I am an actor , I will act cool .
ohh , whoa god !
storage rooms give me the creeps !
monica , come on please hurry up honey !
please ?
rachel , if you want the little round waffles , you got to have to wait until i find the little waffle iron .
i want the little round waffles .
all right .
op , here it is !
right underneath the can of of bug bomb .
i wonder if the best place to put something that cooks food is underneath the can of poison ?
okay , y'know what ?
I will I will have toast !
arghhhh !
!
!
!
!
!
oh my god !
fog him !
fog him !
i do not know what I am going to do about this coat .
I will take it !
that might work !
ooh ooh ooh , yeah !
enh ?
all right , what do you think ?
you are on in 5 ms .
minnelli .
no no no , it is just a bit sudden .
no , it is great .
okay ?
I am totally on board .
i love you too , all righty .
bye .
what is the matter ross ?
nothing .
oh , actually , great news !
i just got off the phone with emily and it looks like I am moving to a new apartment .
woo hoo !
why ?
well , her thought is , and i agree , fresh new furniture , why not a fresh new apartment ?
her cousin has this great place to sublet , it is got a view of the river on one side and columbia on the other .
that is way uptown !
that is like three trains away !
which is great !
i love to ride that rail !
so you are really okay with this ?
yes !
yes !
i mean it is it is kind of far from work , but uh , y'know , I will get so much done on the commute .
i I have been given the gift of time !
now that is so funny , because last christmas i got the gift of space .
we should get them together and make a continuum .
now he is movin ' ?
man , what is emily doing to him ?
ow !
!
he is not even here !
!
!
you guys !
you guys !
we were , we were just in the storage area and we saw this really creepy man !
it was like this crazy eyed , hairy beast man !
he was like a , like a bigfoot or a yeti or something !
and he came at us with an axe , so rachel had to use a bug bomb on him !
yeah , i i i just pulled the tab and i just fogged his yeti ass !
uhh , like dark hair , bushy beard ?
yeah !
yeah , you fogged danny .
please !
we did not fog danny !
who is danny ?
dan just moved in downstairs .
yeah , he just got back from like this four month trek in the andes .
nice fella .
oh he is nice .
he is nice !
y'know , you always stick up for the people we fog !
hi !
you might not remember us , but we are the girls that fogged you .
we are we are really sorry we fogged you .
hi !
just so you know , we we did not mean to fog you , we thought you were like a yeti or something .
hi !
sorry to bother you , but i do not think we can accept your acceptance of our apology , it just does not really seem like you mean it .
yeah .
wow !
that guy is so rude !
really !
what is with that guy ?
i mean you would forgive me if i fogged you .
well you did a little bit .
oh my god , honey , I am so sorry !
i totally forgive you !
really ?
yes !
hey !
hey !
so listen , you know my friend chris who owns the crematorium ?
crematorium chris ?
sure !
he says , that he would cremate my fur coat for free if i umm , y'know , bring in the next person i know who dies .
oh my god !
oh my god , look at these pelts !
do not get too attached , she is having it cremated .
what ?
uhh , phoebe , honey , honey , i know you are quirky and i get a big kick out of it , we all do actually , but if you destroy a coat like this that is like a crime against nature !
not nature , fashion !
this is fashion ?
!
okay , so to you , death is fashion ?
!
that is really funny .
here is phoebe umm , sporting uh , y'know , cutting edge hairy carcass from y'know , the steal traps of wintry russia .
i mean , you really thing this looks good ?
because i do .
i know i miss you too .
i can not wait to see you .
i love you .
bye .
okay , what is in here ?
rocks ?
no no , this is my collection of fossil samples .
so , rocks .
I am really going to miss this apartment .
y'know , ben ben took his first steps right over there .
ohh .
hey , remember when i ran into this thing  and it kind of knocked me out a little ?
i loved this place !
to tell you the truth , i wish i did not have to move .
uhh , are you saying that you are not entirely happy about this ?
well , i mean if uh , if emily gave me a choice  you do have a choice !
!
ross , why are you listening to her ?
!
are you , are you crazy ?
!
why ?
it is not right what emily wants you to do !
she is totally   owww !
!
stop pinching me !
look , now you guys said i only had to keep my mouth shut as long as ross was happy , right ?
well he just told me that he is not entirely happy .
what is going on ?
we all hate emily !
nooo !
!
no , ross , we do not hate emily .
we we just , we just think that you are having to sacrifice a whole lot to make her happy .
yeah !
look , we just think that maybe she is being a little unreasonable .
yes !
yes !
unreasonable !
unreasonable ?
how about we have this conversation when one of you guys gets married !
you have no idea what it takes to make a marriage work !
all right , it is about compromise !
do you always like it ?
no !
do you do it ?
yes !
because it is not all laughing , happy , candy in the sky , drinking coffee at central perk all the time !
it is real life , okay ?
it is what grown ups do !
i think he is right .
you guys hang out at the coffeehouse way too much .
god , i feel so guilty about ross .
oh , i know .
i kind of feel like it is my fault .
kind of ?
if you just kept this to yourself none of this would have happened .
well , I am keeping so many things to myself these days , something was bound to slip out !
well , i think it is very brave what you said .
all right , i can not sit here anymore .
i have to walk places .
pheebs , what are you doing with the coat ?
how about the whole animal rights thing ?
well , I have been reading up and for your information , minks are not very nice .
okay , i admit it !
i love this coat !
okay , i it is the best thing I have ever had wrapped around me , including phil huntley !
remember phil huntley ?
he was fine !
hi !
what ?
yeti i mean danny ?
oh .
listen , I am so sorry .
i would , i would have never fogged you if y'know if you had not looked so  .
y'know .
what ?
what ?
hey !
no no no !
this not cool !
you do not even know me !
so from that you think you have got me all figured out ?
well , you do not !
y'know i i could have toys for underprivileged kids in here !
well , y'know , if if kids like to play with capri pants .
and stop saying that !
i hate that !
fine !
i judged you .
i made a snap judgement .
but you did it too !
and you are worse because you are sticking to your stupid snap judgement !
you can not even open up your mind for a second to see if you are wrong !
what does that say about you ?
what ?
!
okay .
okay .
uh , ross ?
are you still mad at us ?
yep .
oh good !
because we have an I am sorry  song .
y'know what ?
I am really not in the mood .
look , ross , i feel really bad .
i mean , you are going through all this stuff and i just acted like a jerk .
yeah , we are so sorry .
you are kind of stepping on the song .
look , we were way out of line , we totally support you .
whatever you decide , whatever you do .
okay , now you are just taking lines right out of the song !
look , this is hard enough !
i really need you guys right now .
yes !
exactly !
and that is why  why do not you come over tonight ?
and I will make you favorite dinner .
okay .
thanks you guys .
pheebs are you wearing fur ?

yeah you see umm , well , I am an actor .
right ?
so i got to keep my emotions right at the surface y'know ?

i got to lot of balls in the air .
y'know what i mean ?

I am not sure .
hi !
hey , look at you !
where have you been ?
oh , i went to have pizza .
with danny .

ironically , most of the boxes seem to be labeled clothes .
ohh , I am going to miss that big old squishy butt .
and we are done with the chicken fried rice .
hey !
hey !
if he is moving , maybe i should try to get his place !
it would be so cool to live across from you guys !

or we can do the actual telephone thing .
oh my god !
i love this apartment !

!
i can not believe i never realized how great it is !
well that is because your eye immediately goes to the big naked man .
it is amazing !

i mean i think it is great !
for him .
she might be able to do better .
hey guys !
joey !
come here !
come here !
what ?
what ?
phoebe just found out about monica and chandler .
you mean how they are friends and nothing more ?
no .
joey , she knows !
we were at ugly naked guy's apartment and we saw them doing it through the window .
actually , we saw them doing it up against the window .
okay , so now they know that you know and they do not know that rachel knows ?
yes , but y'know what ?
it does not matter who knows what .
now , enough of us know that we can just tell them that we know !
then all the lying and the secrets would finally be over !
or , we could not tell them we know and have a little fun of our own .
wh what do you mean ?
well y'know every time that they say that like they are doing laundry we will just give them a bunch of laundry to do .
ohhh , i i would enjoy that !
no no no !
no no wait rach , you know what would even be more fun ?
telling them .
ehhh , no , i want to do phoebe's thing .
i can not take any  no !
you do not have to do anything !
just do not tell them that we know !
noo !
i can not take any more secrets !
I have got your secrets .
I have got their secrets .
i got secrets of my own y'know !
you do not have any secrets !
oh yeah ?
well , you do not know about hugsy , my bedtime penguin pal .
so umm , how how are we going to mess with them ?
ugh .
well , you could use your position y'know as the roommate .
okay .
and then .
i would use y'know the strongest tool at my disposal .
my sexuality .
hello children !
okay , watch , learn , and do not eat my cookie .
hey .
hey !
ooh , wow that jacket looks great on you !
really ?
yeah the material feels so soft hello mr .
bicep !
have you been working out ?
well , i try to y'know , squeeze things .
are you okay ?
well , if you really want to know , I am oh !
i can not tell you this .
phoebe , it is me .
you can tell me anything .
well actually you are the one person i can not tell this too .
and the one person i want to the most .
what is going on ?
i think it is just y'know that i have not been with a guy in so long and how sometimes you are looking for something and you just don t even see that it is right there in front of you sipping coffee oh no , have i said to much ?
well it is just something to think about .
i know i will .
you are so cute !
how did you get to be so cute ?
well , my grandfather was swedish and my grandmother was actually a tiny little bunny .
okay , now you are even cuter !
!
y'know that is a popular opinion today i must say .
what ?
the weirdest thing happened at the coffee house , i think , i think phoebe was hitting on me .
what are you talking about ?
I am telling you i think phoebe thinks I am foxy .
that is not possible !
ow !
I am sorry it is just , phoebe just always thought you were , you were charming in a , in a sexless kind of way .
oh , y'know i i can not hear that enough .
I am sorry , i think that you just misunderstood her .
no , i did not misunderstand , okay ?
she was all over me !
she touched my bicep for crying out loud !
this bicep ?
well it is not flexed right now !
hey mon , what are you doing now ?
want to come see a movie with us ?
uhh , y'know actually i was going to do some laundry .
oh .
hey chandler , want to do it with me ?
sure , I will do it with ya .
okay .
okay great , hold on a sec !
oh , here you go !
you do not mind do ya ?
that would really help me out a lot !
thanks !
i mean i i do not i think i have enough quarters .
i have quarters !
hey !
hey ross !
any word on the apartment yet ?
well , i called over there and it turns out ugly naked guy is subletting it himself and he is already had like a hundred applicants .
oh .
no no , i got the edge .
i know it is not exactly ethical but i sent him a little bribe to oh , is it that pinball machine with the big bow on it ?
no .
that new mountain bike ?
no .
well what did you send ?
a basket of mini muffins .
but there is a whole table of mini muffin baskets .
which one did you send ?
the small one .
what ?
!
you you actually thought that basket was going to get you the apartment ?
well yeah !
someone sent us a basket at work once and people went crazy over those little muffins .
it was the best day .
your work makes me sad .
oh man !
i want that place so much !
!
i was so sure that was going to work !
there is twelve bucks I will never see again !
all right honey , we would better go if we want to catch that movie .
bye !
bye chandler !
i miss you already .
okay , did you see that ?
!
with the inappropriate and the pinching !
!
actually , i did !
okay , so now do you believe that she is attracted to me ?
ohhh , oh my god !
oh my god !
she knows about us !
are you serious ?
phoebe knows and she is just trying to freak us out !
that is the only explanation for it !
okay but what about y'know my pinchable butt and my bulging biceps she knows !
joey !
yeah ?
phoebe knows about us !
well i did not tell them !
them ?
!
who is them ?
uhhh , phoebe and joey .
joey !
and rachel .
i would have told you but they made me promise not to tell !
oh man !
I am sorry !
but hey , it is over now , right ?
because you can tell them that you know they know and i can go back to knowing absolutely nothing !
unless  no !
not unless !
look this must end now !
oh man , they think they are so slick messing with us !
but see they do not know that we know that they know !
so  ahh yes , the messers become the messies !
noooo .
oh ross , honey you got to stop torturing yourself !
yeah , why do not you just find another apartment ?
look I have already looked at like a thousand apartments this month and none of them even compares to that one !
y'know what you should do ?
huh ?
you should find out what his hobbies are and then use that to bond with him .
yeah !
like if i would strike up a conversation about say umm , sandwiches .
or uh , or my underwear .
I am listening .
see ?
that is a great idea !
and !
i know ugly naked guy because we have been watching him for like five years so that gives me back my edge !
oh , let us see now he had the trampoline .
he broke that .
well , he had gravity boots .
yeah , he broke those too .
so he likes to break stuff .
okay , I have got to go pick up ben but i i will figure something out .
hey , did not he used to have a cat ?
i would not bring that up , it would probably just bum him out .
yeah , poor cat , never saw that big butt coming .
right .
hello !
oh yeah !
hey !

'bring me the ' and   rach ?

hi .
oh , I am sorry .
oh , this is so stupid !
i mean , i gave barry up , right ?
i should be happy for them !
i am , I am happy for them .
really .

oh , oh , i guess it would be different if i were   with somebody .
whoah , uh , what happened to , uh , 'forget relationships !
I am done with men ! '
the whole , uh , penis embargo ?
oh , i do not know .
i guess it is not about no guys , it is about the right guy , y'know ?
i mean , with barry , it was safe and it was easy , but there was no heat .
with paolo , that is all there was , was heat !
and it was just this raw , animal , sexual .
.
.
wait wait .
i , i got it .
i was there .
well , i mean , do you think you can ever have both ?
y'know ?
someone who is like , who is like your best friend , but then also can make your toes curl ?
yes .
yes .
yes !
yes , i really do !

.
.
hi .
.
gets interrupted .
hi !
hi , how was the movie ?
wonderful !
so good !
suck fest .
toootal chick flick .
i I am sorry it was not one of those movies with , like , y'know , guns and bombs and , like , buses going really fast .
.
.
hey , i do not need violence to enjoy a movie .
just so long as there is a little nudity .
there was nudity !
i meant female nudity .
alright ?
i do not need to see lou grant frolicking .
alright , I have got to go .
c'mon , marcel !
c'mon !
we are going to go take a bath .
yes we are , are not we ?
yes , we are .
they are still just friends , right ?
and i will see you tomorrow !
that is right , you are going to spend tomorrow at aunt rachel's , are not you .
oh , hang on , hang on .
does aunt monica get a say in this ?
'pwease , aunt monica , pwease ? '
oh , unclench .
you are not even going to be there .
i can not believe we are even having this discussion .
i agree .
I am , like , in disbelief .
i mean , do not you think if things were going to happen with rachel , they would have happened already ?
I am telling you , she said she is looking for a relationship with someone exactly like me .
she really said that ?
well , i added the 'exactly like me ' part .
.
.
but she said she is looking for someone , and someone is going to be there tonight .
'tonight ' tonight ?
well , i think it is perfect .
y'know , it is just going to be the two of us , she spent all day taking care of my monkey .
.
.
i can not remember the last time i got a girl to take care of my monkey .
anyway , i figured after work I would go pick up a bottle of wine , go over there and , uh , try to woo her .
hey , y'know what you should do ?
you should take her back to the 1890's , when that phrase was last used .
now , now the one in the feather boa , that is dr .
francis .
now , she used to be a man .
okay , now look , see , there is raven .
we hate her .
we are glad she is dying .
okay    wh   wh   marcel , are you playing with monica's shoes ?
you know you are not supposed to pl   whoah .
marcel , did you poo in the shoe ?
marcel , bad monkey !
oh !
oh !

little engagement gift .
I am sure you did not register for that .
who died ?
who died ?
roll him over !
oh , c'mon , roll him over !
oh .
.
.
!
well , we know it was not dexter , right marcel ?
because    marcel ?
marc    how could you lose him ?
i do not know .
we were watching tv , and then he pooped in monica's shoe   wait .
he pooped in my shoe ?
which one ?
i do not know .

rachel lost marcel .
oh no , how ?
he   he pooped in my shoe .

alright alright .
you are a monkey .

I am feeling kind of crazy .
you want to go to newark ?
uh , okay , yeah , we could do that , but before we head off to the murder capital of the north east , i was , uh , kind of wanting to run something by you .
y'know how we were , uh , y'know , talking before about , uh , relationships and stuff ?

i   i   i ca   i can not believe this .
i mean , all i asked you to do was keep him in the apartment .
i know , i know , I am sorry   no , y'know what , i guess it is partially my fault .
y'know , i should not have , uh , asked you to start off with a monkey .
i should have started you off with like a pen or a pencil .
ross , I am doing everything that i can , I have got everybody looking for him , and i    oh !
who is it ?
see ?
I have even called animal control !
you called animal control ?
uh huh .
.
.
why .
.
.
do you not like them ?
marcel is an illegal exotic animal .
I am not allowed to have him in the city .
if they find him , they will take him away from me .
of okay , now see , you never ever ever told us that .
.
.
that is right , i .
.
because i did not expect you were going to invite them to the apartment !

oh , y'know what ?
that was a complete misunderstanding !
yeah , we thought we had a monkey , but we we did not .
turned out it was a hat .

what'm i saying ?
cat !
hi .
we checked the third and fourth floor , no one's seen marcel .
my uncle marcel .

oh , no no no .
nono , this is just vintage rachel .
i mean , things just sort of happen around you .
i mean , you are off in rachel land , doing your rachel thing , totally oblivious to people's monkeys , or to people's feelings .
.
.
ross .
i do not even want to hear it , you are just .
.
.
ross .

but if you take this monkey , i will lose one of the most important people in my life .
you can hate me if you want , but please do not punish him .
c'mon , luisa , you have a chance to be the bigger person here !
take it !
alright .
well then how about i call your supervisor , and i tell her that you shot my friend in the ass with a dart ?
it will be nice to get this off finally , will not it ?
yes it will .
or we can leave it on for now , that is fine .
y'know , with the right pair of pumps , that would be a great little outfit .

yeah .
well , i mean , when i first met you , y'know , i thought maybe , possibly , you might be .
.
.
you did ?

huh .
did , uh .
.
.
any of the rest of you guys think that when you first met me ?
i did .
yeah , i think so , yeah .
not me .
nono , me neither .
although , uh , y'know , back in college , susan sallidor did .
you are kidding !
did you tell her i was not ?
no .
no , it is just because , uh , i kind of wanted to go out with her too , so i told her , actually , you were seeing bernie spellman .
.
.
who also liked her , so .
.
.
well , this is fascinating .
so , uh , what is it about me ?
i dunno , because you are smart , you are funny .
.
.
ross is smart and funny , d'you ever think that about him ?
what is it ?

twice ?
oh , that sucks !
you guys okay ?
i dunno , it is weird .
i mean , i know she is gone , but i just do not feel , uh .
.
.
maybe that is because she is not really gone .
nono , she is gone .

the right guy is just around the corner !
okay , are we done with that ?

any woman would be lucky to have ya .
well maybe it would make me feel better if i slept with joey .
rachel !
you okay ?
excuse me , aaron ?
hi !
umm , i have a little problem with the schedules .
originally , i wasn t supposed to work today , and i have this wedding that i really have to be at .
it s my best friend s , and i m officiating so i really can t work past four .
i m having surgery !
yeah , i i just made up the stuff about the wedding because i didn t want you to worry about me .

it s not on my head .
hey !

he s one guy in a huge city !
oh my god !
is that him ?
that is an old , chinese woman !
he could be in disguise , y know .

if you re chandler and and you want to hide , where is the last place on earth people would think you d go ?
so this is your office ?
how did you guys find me ?

what the hell are you doing ?
!
panicking !
and using the internet to try to prove that i m related to monica .
how is she ?
she s fine .
she doesn t know you re gone .
and she doesn t have to know , okay ?
now come on , we re going home .
no !
no !
no !
i can t do that !
why not ?
!
because if i go home , we re going to become the bings !
i can t be the bings !
what s wrong with being the bings ?
the bings have horrible marriages !
they yell .
they fight .
and they use the pool boy as a pawn in their sexual games !
chandler , have you ever put on a black cocktail dress and asked me up to your hotel room ?
no .
then you are neither of your parents !
it s not just their marriage !
i mean , look at yours .
look at everybody s !
the only person that can make marriage work is paul newman !
and i ve met me ; i am not paul newman .
i don t race cars !
i don t make popcorn !
none of my proceeds go to charity .
but look chandler , right now , no one has a lower opinion of you than i do .
but i totally believe you can do this .
i want to .
i love her so much , but i m afr it s too huge .
y know , okay .

dearly beloved , i m sorry i m a little late .
you may be confused by this now ,  but you won t be memorial day weekend 2002 .
well , let s get started before the groom takes off again .
huh ?
we are gathered here today , to join this man and this woman in the bonds of holy matrimony .
i ve known monica and chandler for a long time , and i can not imagine two people more perfect for each other .
and now , as i ve left my notes in my dressing room .
we shall proceed to the vows .
monica ?
he took off ?
go on !
go on .
chandler , for so long i i wondered if i would ever find my prince , my soul mate .
then three years ago , at another wedding i turned to a friend for comfort .
and in stead , i found everything that i d ever been looking for my whole life .
and now here we are with our future before us and i only want to spend it with you , my prince , my soul mate , my friend .
unless you don t want to .
you go !
chandler ?
no , that s okay .
monica i thought this was going to be the most difficult thing i ever going to had to do .
but when i saw you walking down that aisle i realized how simple it was .
i love you .
any surprises that come our way it s okay , because i will always love you .
you are the person i was meant to spend the rest of my life with .
you want to know if i m sure ?
you may not kiss the bride .
so , i guess by the powers vested in my by the state of new york and the internet guys , i now pronounce you husband and wife .
oh wait !
do you take each other ?
i do .
i do .
yeah you do !
rings ?
aw crap !
okay uh uh let s let s do the rings .

once again , i pronounce you husband and wife .
now kiss her again .
i love you .
and i know about the baby .
what baby ?
our baby .
we have a baby ?
phoebe found your pregnancy test in the trash .
i didn t take a pregnancy test .
then who did ?
oh and they re going to have a baby .
uh huh .
how did the job stuff go ?
he offered me one .
you know what ?
this calls for a bottle of israels finest .
the job is in paris .
oh , god !
please , somebody say something .
so if you take this job you will be moving to paris ?
or facing a bitch of a commute .
i know , it is huge , and it is scary , and it is .
.
.
really far , far away from you guys , but this is such an incredible opportunity for me .
and I have already talked to them about our situation with emma , and they said they will do whatever we need to make us feel comfortable .
okay .
i mean , I will fly back and forth , they will fly you out .
.
.
anything we want .
my boss said i might be getting a new lamp in my cubicle .
all right , we will work it out .
thank you !
thank you !
yeah , yeah !
you sure this is what you want ?
i think it is .
ooh , what is going on ?
i got a really incredible job offer .
hey , great !
all right !
good for you !
it is in paris .
what ?
no , no , no !
no , no .
.
.
no .
.
.
no , no .
.
.
no , too much is changing , okay ?
first , phoebe getting married  congratulations !
.
.
.
and then these two move into a stupid house in the stupid suburbs .
.
.
hey , this afternoon you said you would be supportive .
.
.
well , it comes and goes .
i would not trust it .
look , you guys .
.
.
this is really , really important to me .
and it means a lot if you could try to get on board .
of course we can .
congratulations .
yay !
joey .
.
.
no , no , no .
my hugs are reserved for people staying in america .
joey , it would mean so .
.
.
hey !
no !
get your france going arms away from me .
joey .
.
.
you okay with this ?
well , it makes me feel sad , but .
.
.
talking to ross .
i see .
well , rachel moving to another country ?
not being able to see her every day .
how can i be okay with this ?
i know , but what are we going to do ?
she really needs this job .
do you think if the ralph lauren people offered her her old job back , she would take it ?
how is that going to happen ?
is this the best way to use one of your three magic wishes ?
i do not know .
i could talk to her boss .
yeah !
i met him at that christmas party .
we really hit it off .
you mean the guy who kept calling you ron ?
i did not say we were brothers .
hey phoebe .
hey , tell me what you think .
all right .
the house next door to the one that we are buying in westchester ?
just went on the market .
i want to take a look at it , but chandler does not .
we close escrow tomorrow , so seeing another house can only confuse us , and we are easily confused .
we are not very bright .
but what if it is better than ours ?
should we at least look ?
what do you think pheebs ?
well , i think that shirt makes you look like you should work at a baskin robbins .
.
.
anyway .
.
.
hey , is not joey's agent estelle leonard ?
yeah .
she died .
you are kidding !
that is terrible !
yeah , last saturday .
wow !
she was the first black man to fly solo across the atlantic .
oh , wait a minute , i read the wrong one .
oh yeah ?
yeah , she was just an agent .
joey's going to be *so * upset .
i know .
*he * always wanted to be the first black man to cross the atlantic .
well , we cannot tell joey about this .
he is already flipping out about everything that is changing .
this will push him over the edge .
seriously , you do not think we should tell him ?
well , not for a little while .
let us just give him a few days to get used to everything else .
what if he reads it in the paper ?
unless snoopy says it to charlie brown , i think we are okay .
yeah , I am a friend of rachel green's .
uhm , actually we met at the christmas party about two years ago .
close .
ron .
uhm , well .
.
.
I am here to see if you will give rachel her job back .
oh , no .
at first i have to get you to agree .
then we will see if she wants to come back .
look , she loved her job here .
and let us face it : you are not going to find anyone who did it as well as she did it .
is not that true ?
huh , i took a shot there .
i see .
.
.
thanks very much .
is this your son ?
oh , nothing , it s just , it s close to ron .
does he .
.
does little ross like dinosaurs by any chance ?
how would he like to come with me to the museum of natural history after everyone else has left , just the two of us , and he can touch anything he wants .
.
i just heard it as you must have heard it and that s not good .
let me start again .
i m a paleontologist , you ll be there with us and the touching refers only to bones  fossils !
you let rachel come back , and it s done .
yeah !
yes !
thank you !
this is great .
thank you so much .
and i swear , your kid is going to have the time of his life .
he ll be fine .
hey phoebe .
hey .
everything ok ?
i m just mad at my agent .
estelle ?
why ?
there s a part in a tv movie that i would be perfect for and i didn t even be put up for it !
she d better have a good reason .
i m guessing she does .
well  i m want to hear it , because she keeps doing this .
well , no , no , wait , wait , wait .
all right , i got to go .
just listen .
promise me , that you will wait a minute before you call her .
ok .
why ?
because a promise between friends means never having to give a reason .
i love that saying !
hello ?
i was just going to call you !
that s weird .
yeah , actually i am !
that s it ?
you know , it seems all you do lately is drop the ball .
no , no , look .
all i m saying is that you re my agent , ok ?
and you re not getting me into any auditions and i m tired of it .
i m saying that   .
this is not working for me anymore , ok ?
estelle , you re fired .
goodbye .
.
man , tough week for estelle !
hi .
hi .
emma left her stuffed t rex at my house .
you know she can t sleep without it .
oh , well , she s asleep now .
stop forcing that thing on her .
ok .
oh , you re not going to believe what happened to me today !
ralph lauren called , and gave me my job back !
nooo !
yee .
i mean , it was so weirdest thing .
they fired me and then out of nowhere they just hire me back !
i mean , that place must have been falling apart without me .
so , you re not going to paris .
no , i m still going .
wh  wh what ?
when the louis vuitton people found out that ralph lauren wanted me back , the offered me more money !
isn t that great ?
yeeeah !
hi .
we re buying the house next door , and we were wondering if we could just take a look around .
thanks .
it feels like we re cheating on our house .
and if we re going to cheat , shouldn t it be with like a hot , younger house , that does stuff that our house won t do ?
ours is so much better !
this living room is smaller , the dining room looks like a cave !
what a hole !
love it !
they could be our neighbors , what are they like ?
hey joey , want come with me to  are you ok ?
yeah , i just  i just feel bad about firing estelle .
this is got to be killing her .
no , that wouldn t kill her .
ordinary embolism might .
i don t know .
she s got to be taking it hard , i was like her only client .
except for this guy who eats paper .
and i m guessing he eats more money than he makes .
look , i know she s not a great agent , but she did stick with me for ten years .
i m going to call her and hire her again .
no , no , no !
do not call her !
you wait for her to call you  why ?
because patience is the road to understanding  which  .
.
.
is the key .
.
.
to a happy heart .
you blow me away .
all right , so promise you are going to wait for her to call you ?
i promise .
and that means , never having to give a reason .
and yet i never run into beyonce !
do not , do not !
no , actually , we are buying the house next door .
why !
?
i do not know why .
this can not be happening !
okay , the realtor said another couple made an offer .
maybe the janice's will not get it !
maybe the other couple will .
the only way that that is going to happen , is if the other couple are the hitlers .
okay , okay ,  all right .
what if we got both houses ?
huh ?
we can turn this house into a guest house .
that is a great idea !
and by the way , i do not mean to sound distasteful , but when did you start crapping money !
?
okay , you come up with an idea .
alright alright , we still have three hours till escrow closes on our house .
we can still get out .
but we love our house .
will we love it so much with her next door ?
and she is going to be louder out here too .
just the crickets and  oh my god  !
okay , but if we do not get this house , she is stil going to show up wherever we go !
i mean , at least if she is here , it eliminates the element of suprise .
i mean , never again will you have to hear the three words that make your balls jump back up inside your body .
well , we have to do something .
we can not have her living next door .
oh , that does it too .
it is me .
ron .
look , i um , i now rachel turned you down but i think there is a way you might be able to get her to come back .
just hear me out .
how would you feel about offering her a raise ?
perhaps i can persuade you .
what if you can give your son this  genuine pterodactyl egg  replica .
huh ?
so ?
we have a deal ?
yes !
yes !
oh ,  believe me , the ladies , they love it !
good , because the ladies , not so much .
oh my god .
hello ?
joey , it is estelle .
estelle ?
yeah , i wanted to call and tell you that there is no hard feelings for firing me .
ok ay .
i just , i can not believe you are calling me ?
well , i did not think i should just drop by .
.
.
no , no , no !
do not drop by , do not drop by !
anyway , you did what you had to do .
I am okay .
can i ask you something ?
uhm , what is it like there ?
it is alright .
look kiddo , i got to go .
good luck with the career .
you are going to be huge .
thanks for everything estelle .
bye .
out of area  .
boy , I will say .
the hitlers will be so disappointed .
wait !
i just want you to know that .
.
.
I am so happy you are going to be here .
because .
.
.
that way .
.
.
we can pick up where we left off .
i never stopped loving you .
yeah , yeah , yeah !
i want you .
.
.
i need you .
.
.
i must have you janice litman goralnik neihosenstein .
now that you live next door , we can be together every day .
sid and monica never have to know a thing .
obviously .
do not say that .
do not tangle the dream and take it away .
i understand .
they are never coming down now .
hi !
hey !
you are never going to believe what happened to me today .
what ?
ralph lauren called again and they offered me more money .
they did ?
yeah .
it was the weirdest thing .
zelner called me and he said we will do everything we can to get you back .
and that i should thank some ron .
.
.
i do not even know what department that guy's in .
so , what are you going to do ?
well , i took it .
that is great !
so you are staying in new york !
you are excited , right ?
ye ah .
yeah !
you know , the money's great .
it is certainly the easier choice .
.
.
right !
yeah , you know , was i looking forward to going to paris ?
sure .
you know , was i excited about working in the fashion capital of the world ?
ooh , absolutely .
.
.
oh .
.
.

yeah , but you know , this is .
.
.
it is fine .
I am fine going back to a job where I have pretty much gotten everything out of that i possibly can .
.
.
uhm , i had not no you .
.
.
i had no idea you were so excited about paris .
uhm , i mean , you said you were scared .
well yeah , but i mean , it was good scared though , you know ?
like when i moved to new york scared .
or uhm , when i found out i was going to have emma scared .
.
.
but this is .
.
.
fine .
this is going to be good .
you should go .
what ?
it is what you want .
you should go .
you really think so ?
i really do .
but i already told zelner that i would come back .
.
.
I am sure he will understand .
all right .
all right !
I am going to do it .
I am going to go to paris .
yeah .
.
.
yeah !
I am going to paris .
thank you , ross !
yeah , yeah , oh !
oh !
oh , I am so happy .
then I am happy too .
thank you all for coming .
we are here today to pay respects to a wonderful agent and a beautiful woman .
.
.
inside .
as estelle's only two clients we would like to say a few words .
dude , where is my speech ?
that is entertaining .
al zebooker everybody .
tell him .
no .
tell him , tell him .
just .
please tell him .
shut up !
tell me what ?
look at you , you will not even look at him .
oh , come on tell me .
i could use another reason why women will not look at me .
all right , all right , all right .
last night , i had a dream that , uh , you and i , were .
.
.
doing it on this table .
wow !
exellent dream score .
why , why , why would you dream that ?
more importantly , was i any good ?
well , you were pretty damn good .
interesting , because in my dreams , I am allways surprisingly inadequate .
well , last night you seemed to know your way around the table .
i love it , when we share .
you are okay there ?
i can not belive you two had sex in her dream .
I am sorry , it was a one time thing .
i was very drunk and i was somebody else's subconscious .
hello rachel .
get off .
uh , uh , give me .
can you see me operating a drill press ?
i do not know .
what are you wearing ?
pheebs , why would you want to operate a drill press ?
just for some short term work .
you know , until i get back some of my massage clients .
pirates again ?
no , nothing like that .
i was just .
such a dummie .
i taught this massage yourself at home workshop .
and they are .
hey , hey , chan .
she could work for you .
thanks joey , that is a good idea .
what .
.
.
i could , i could do it .
what is it ?
well , my secretary is going to be out for a couple of weeks .
she is having one of her boobs redused .
it is a whole big boob story .
i could be a secretary .
well , you know phoebs .
i do not know if it is your kind of thing , because it involves a lot of being normal .
for a large portion of the day .
i could do that .
what are you playing with ?
oh , it is my new beeper .
what the hell does a paleontologist need a beeper for ?
is it like for dinosaur emergencies .
'help , come quick , they are still extinct . '
no , it is for when carol goes into labor .

if you don t sail your boat , what do you do on it ?
oh , it s great !
it s a great place to just kind of , sit , hang around , drink a few beers , eat some chips .
well , it s good that you finally have a place to do that .
y know joey , i could teach you to sail if you want .

dad must really like you , he doesn t ask just anyone to play .
yeah and he didn t really ask for you , he asked for chancy , i assumed he meant you .
well , did did you correct him ?
no , i i thought it would be more fun this way .
this is so cool , maybe this is something you can do every week .
or you can sit with him on the front porch and make sure no one steals the trash cans .
he does that every week too .
oh , just so you know , you you have to let him win .
yeah .
he hates to lose .
oh no problem , maybe i ll play with my left hand .
you re not a lefty ?
does anybody know me ?
!
what s wrong phoebe ?
i just went to my old apartment to get you the the cookie recipe and the stupid fire burned it up !
no !
!
why didn t you make a copy and and keep it in a fireproof box and keep it at least a hundred yards from the original ?
!
!
because i m normal !
that was the one legacy my grandmother left me , and i know you wanted it as an engagement present .
oh , we have to get you an engagement present ?
don t worry about it pheebs .
no one got me an engagement present .
okay , here i wish you health and happiness .
an old cookie ?
this is what happens when you don t register for gifts !

we can t accept this .
why not ?
because it s gross .
no !
wait !
i think i can figure out the recipe from this cookie !
i do stuff like this at work all the time .
really ?
!
yeah !
i bet i can do it .
okay , we owe you a present .
two !
i ve been engaged twice !
look at this clown !
just because he s got a bigger boat he thinks he can take up the whole river .
get out of the way jackass !
who names his boat coast guard anyway ?
that is the coast guard .
what are they doing out here ?
the coast s all the way over there .
joey , just ignore the boats all right ?
we re not finished with the lesson yet .
all right .
okay , i m just going to go over the basic points just one more time , are you ready ?
come on rach , not again .
i got it !
okay ?
let s start sailing , and i want to go over there  where that boatload of girls is !
yo ho ho !
oh , okay .
is that what you want to do ?
you want to go over and give a little shout out to the old , hot chickas ?
okay , let s do that sailor joe .
quick question though ,  what s this called ?
uh , boat rope .
wrong !
how do you get the mainsail up ?
uhh , rub it ?
no .
what do you do if i say we are coming about ?
i d say , come again .
no no , wait i i i know this one , i know this one , uh  time s up , now your dead .

okay , you just go on and make your little jokey jokes , but if you do not know what you are doing out at sea you will die at sea .
am i getting through to you sailor ?
!
yes .
don t just say yes !
this isn t a game , joey you can really get hurt out here .
okay , so do you want to pay attention or do you want to die ?
!
i want to make a ship to shore call to chandler .
all right , i definitely taste nutmeg .
you do ?
you don t ?
well , that s the difference between a professional and a layman .
that and arrogance .
hey .
hey !
how was sailing ?
i don t want to talk about it .
y know , you could ve at least saved me a whole cookie .
women are mean !
!
!
i can t believe that !
now the only thing left of my grandmother s legacy is this crumb .
i wish you a long and happy marriage .
hey .
hey !
how was it ?
well i had a great time !
umm , chancy on the other hand  i will tell the story !
it was going great .
i let him win .
we were bonding .
he even said i could call him dad .
and what did he ask you not to call him ?
daddy .
all right look , here s the story .
well , we had just finished playing racquetball and we were going to take a steam .
i walk into the steam room and it was really steamy .
so i take off my glasses and that s when in happened .
guys ?
over here .
oh my god chandler !
i can t believe it !
i know .
you gave my father a lap dance !
why do they put so much steam in there ?
!
because otherwise they d have to call it the room room .
why ?
okay ?
why ?
wh wh why did that have to happen ?
come on , it s not that big a deal !
not that big a deal ?
there there was touching of things .
now , i know you wanted to bond with my dad , but did you really have to bond to that part ?
listen , i m sure that dad doesn t care .
he probably thought this was funny ; he ll be telling this story for years !
i don t want him to tell this story for years .
oh , but he will .
he still tells the story how monica tried to escape from fat camp .
i wasn t escaping .
then how did you get caught in the barbed wire ?
i was trying to help out a squirrel .
you were trying to eat it !
if that is your father calling to tell this story then the marriage is off !
come on .
hello ?
i m sorry you have the wrong number .
okay , i ll call you later dad .
i love you .
all right , i m off to see your dad .
whoa whoa , aren t you a little over dressed ?
yeah , and and you better make sure he tips you this time .
look , i figured i would try to convince him not to tell the story anymore , and i figure the best way to do that is face to face and by face i don t mean his lap .
and by face , i don t mean my ass .
hey are you getting monica and chandler an engagement present ?
i don t know .
y know , they didn t get us anything .
thank you !
hey .
hey .

i was just trying to teach you .
well , lesson learned !
rachel is mean !
yeeeeeep  yep yep yep yep yep .
i remember when she took out on her dad s boat she wouldn t let me help at all .
excuse me , i wanted you to help , but you couldn t move your arms because you were wearing three life jackets .
you have to respect the sea !
look joey , i m sorry if if you thought that was mean , but i got to tell ya something .
that was not mean .
okay , my father is mean .
he used to yell at me all the time on the boat , i mean it was horrible .
i was just being a good teacher .

?
well , does a good student drink seven beers during his first lesson ?
six and a half !
you knocked that last one out of my hand !
remember ?
yeah , i didn t want you to get hit by the boom !

yes but there is six of us so we would only have to get struck by lightning 7 times .
i like those odds !
seriously you guys , i can not believe you are going to spend 250 dollars on the lottery , i mean that is such a bunch of boohaki .
I will ask .
boohaki ?
oh oh , we think emma is about to start talking so we are trying to be careful about what words we use in front of her .
yeah so get ready to hear alot of ehm .
boohaki , goshdarnit and brotherpucker .
how do you know she is going to start talking ?
well when i talk to her i almost feel like she understands what I am saying .
kind of like joey .
what is that now ?
god !
look at all these tickets !
it is so exciting !
you know i have not won anything since the sixth grade .
pie eating contest ?
oh !
you assume because i was heavy that is the only way i could win something ?
no , i saw a picture of you covered in blueberries .
that was a good day !
they are towing your car , they are towing your car !
!
I am parked in a garage on morton !
they are towing a car .
and i am seeing .
spots .
oh my god ross !
you do not have emma !
and rachel you do not have emma !
where is emma ?
who has emma !
?
joey relax !
my mother picked her up two hours ago .
you were there !
i was ?
i did ?
she dropped off a casserole ?
oh yeah !
the casserole lady .
so , did you come by to watch us win the big bucks ?
yeah , uh .
.
.
and then i figured after you win , we could all go out to the balcony and see a night rainbow with gremlins dancing on top of it !
do not touch the phone !
I will get it , I will get it , I will get it !
!
think he washed his hands ?
hello ?
hey charlie , what do you know ?
what is going on ?
chandler is supposed to find out if he is getting an assistent job at his ad agency .
but out of the 15 interns , they are only hiring three .
ooh !
tough odds !
yeah if only it were a sure thing like your 24 state lottery !
look who is coming around !
damnit .
alright call me when you know more .
did you get it ?
one of the slots got filled .
by you !
?
sense the tone !
no that kid nate got it .
oh !
i hate that guy !
i mean come on kid !
pull up your pants !
yeah i know .
well , there is two spots left right ?
yeah .
i mean i want this so much !
i mean , i want to get one , i want my friend charlie to get one .
except i do not care about charlie .
hey you guys !
ok , you are not going to believe this !
i just saw my psychic and she said i was definitely going to win the lottery tonight !
hey that reminds me , i thought we could use some extra luck so i brought a wishbone home from work .
a psychic and a wishbone ?
guys !
give someone else a chance !
alright , who wants to do it ?
oh can i ?
vegetarians never get to do the wishbone .
it is really not fair either !
you know , just because we do not eat the meat does not mean we do not like to play with the carcasses !
ok , hey rach ?
oh no , I am good , i do not want to get that turkey smell all over my hands .
I will do it !
!
it will get the casserole stink off of mine .
i hope i win !
well , it does not really matter  .
.
.
you are both wishing for the same thing , right ?
i can not tell you what I am wishing for !
else .
you know .
will not come true !
right !
.
.
but we know  what you are wishing for !
can not really say !
i understand , but you are wishing for what we think you are wishing for , are not you ?
I am not really comfortable with these questions !
one , two , three !
i won , hey !
you know what , I am sure your wish is going to come true , but , you guys    just in case , maybe a genie will come out if we rub this lamp !
ah !
!
that thing gets hot !
!
you know , ross , just keep making your jokes .
how are you going to feel if we actually do win ?
uh , you are not going to win .
oh , i know , i know , the odds are against us , but somebody has to win , and it could be us !
and then how you going to feel ?
you know , we are going to be all like oh everybody , let us take our helicopters up to the cape  and you are going to be all like oh , i can not guys , I will meet you guys up there , i got to gas up the hyundai  ok , I have heard myself on tape and i sound nothing like that .
i can see the headline now : lottery winners ' friend filled with regret eats own arm  .
why would i eat my own arm ?
well you would not , but we own the paper , we can print whatever we want .
you know what , ross ?
I am going to throw in 50 bucks for you .
why ?
because i know that you think the lottery is boohaki  but we are all here and going to watch the numbers and have fun .
and you are my brother , and i want you to be a part of this .
you do not have to do that , I will pay for myself .
but just the fact that you want me to have fun with you guys    that is so sweet !
come here  get a room !
ok , so now that you are in , what are you going to do if we win ?
i do not know , probably just invest it .
ooh !
calm down  .
.
.
seriously , that is your fantasy ?
to invest it ?
oh , I am sorry , did i say invest it  ?
i meant be cool and piss it all away   ooh , ooh , i know !
we should pool all own money and buy the knicks !
i do not really care about the knicks .
oh , you will when i pick you as starting forward .
you would do that ?
i never get picked !
you know , I am not sure a sports team is the way to go .
you are not going to let me buy the knicks ?
?
i can not believe you are taking this away from me !
you are right , it has been you dream for over 15 seconds .
uh , how long until they announce the numbers , mommy ?
I will take this one too  uh  .
.
.
mommy ?
oh , I have gotten into the habit of calling rachel mommy  when we are around emma .
which i now realize we are not  .
.
.
I am hoping that if she hears it enough it will be her first word .
although if we are going to do that , we should probably call me daddy  too .
oooh , i like that , daddy   i  .
.
.
i was just talking about rachel .
oooh , is daddy getting angry ?
is daddy going to spank me ?
well that depends  .
.
.
have you been a baaad gi  .
.
no i can not .
hello ?
hello ?
oh , hey charlie .
did anybody else hear ?
.
.
.
what ?
susan got it ?
?
how ?
oh man , i would have slept with him !
!
.
.
alright , bye .
dude , I am sorry .
but hey , there is one spot left , right ?
well no , charlie's going to get that .
hey , do not say that !
you got just as good a chance as anybody else of getting that job !
he is the boss's son .
come on , lottery !
!
ooh , you guys , it starts in like 20 minutes .
ok , here we go .
we need to sort out the tickets as quickly as possible to see if we have won .
so does anybody have any ideas how to organize this ?
ok , how about this : we divide them into 6 groups of 40 , and the remaining 10 can be read by whoever finishes their pile first .
ooh , i have another idea !
I am sorry , idea time is over .
ok , well , are all the tickets in the bowl ?
yeah .
what about the ones you have on the nightstand ?
there are no tickets on the nightstand !
yes there are , i just saw them a few minutes ago .
un , no you did not !
you must be mistaken !
honey , there are like 20 tickets on the nightstand !
chandler , sense the tone !
!
well , well , well , look what mommy found !
!
ok , fine !
!
i bought 20 extra tickets for me and chandler .
uh !
the psychic also said that i would be betrayed .
i can not believe this , i thought we were all in this together !
hey , you just got in 5 minutes ago !
3 minutes ago !
!
!
i do not know why that is important  .
.
.
i was with you the whole time we were in connecticut , when did you even get those ?
when you were reading the dirty magazines without taking off the plastic !
I will show you how .
ok , well monica , suppose one of your special  tickets win ?
how are you going to feel when you win the lottery and you lose all your friends ?
please  .
.
.
if i win the lottery , you guys are not going to leave me .
someone gave me a basket of mini muffins last week and i could not get rid of you for 3 days !
chandler , would you just tell her what she did was wrong ?
she is right , you should not have bought tickets just for us  .
.
.
ahhh !
let me finish  .
.
.
however , it does not look like I am going to get this job so i can not afford to have principles , so screw you , the tickets are ours !
!
there is the man i married !
!
all right , believe me.if you win the lottery , it is the last you are going to hear from us !
fine !
do not be my friends !
I will buy new friends !
yeah , and then I will pay for their plastic surgery so they would look just like you !
oh !
alright , you know what ?
that is it !
i want my share of the tickets  !
yeah , i want my tickets too  !
and I am buying the knicks !
and steffi graff , ah ah !
than i want mine , too  !
and if i win I am going to put it all into a very low yield bond .
oh , you guys !
we have got to keep all the tickets together  no , no !
we should divide them up  and i should get extra because we used my card to buy them !
hey , if anybody gets extra tickets , it should be me !
this all thing was my idea !
oh , yeah !
thanks for inventing the lottery !
ok , that is it !
just give'them to me !
I will split them up !
oh !
ooooohhhhh !
hey , hey !
!
ooooohhhhh !
fine , i can not take it anymore !
I am putting an end to this !
oh , if she jumps , i get her tickets .
no , no !
if we are not doing it together , we are not doing it at all !
so , say goodbye to your tickets !
.
do not come any closer !
can i come a little bit closer , valuable things are getting squished .
.
.
no , what is more important , your friends or money ?
money !
friends .
.
.
hey monica , what about your extra tickets ?
they are all in there !
even these five that i hid in my bra  .
.
.
monica !
ok , good !
you guys were so scared !
there was no way i was going to dump this .
.
.
oh god , no !
i think i broke your bowl .
go , go , go !
!
what a beautiful night to be running around the street , looking for tickets .
and the wind sure made it fun .
phoebe , we lost half of them .
so , what ?
monica , we have the winning ticket !
my psychic said i was going to win , remember ?
weird .
.
your psychic did not mention anything about the scary pigeon .
.
.
as a matter of fact she said that is how i am going to die .
so , excuse me for being a little skittish .
hey , there is two messages .
these could be from work !
oh , play them !
ok , here we go !
well , i bet that was very hard for him to do .
this is  shhh !
oh god , i am so sorry honey .
.
.
oh , it is so unfair .
it is like that time they promoted sandra over me at work .
oh , is she related to ralph lauren ?
no , she was just much better at job than me !
guys , the drawing is about to start !
you know what ?
we should call my mum's house and say goodnight to emma before she goes down .
oh yeah , it is a good idea !
honey , you have been really strong about this , i know how badly you wanted that job .
yeah , you know , i really thought i deserved it .
but .
.
.
let us go win the lottery .
.
.
i mean , we still have 130 chances to win , right ?
131 !
goodnight sweetheart !
i love you .
and remember , you are daddy's little girl .
.
.
phoebe's totally ruined that for me .
.
.
hi mum , put her back on !

my god , i can already feel myself changing .
i got that !
oh , we have one too !

actually , tomorrow night kind of depends on how tonight goes .
oh , uh , listen , about tonight .
.
.
no , no , no , do not you dare bail on me .
the only reason she is goin ' out with me is because i said i could bring a friend for her friend .

mon , maybe one of these guys wants to wear your dress .
i m going to go shave .
yeah well , i m going to go spit .

for the first time in weeks , i am somewhat comfortable .
fine !
fine !
y know what ?
whatever you want .
okay ?
you re the mommy .

it s bad enough you call your own mother that .
i m actually with her on this one .
i thought i knew who the enemy was , but it was you all along .
okay , this is it .
it s my big fight scene coming up .
ross .
yeah ?
can i ask you something ?
uh huh .
when carol was pregnant with ben  mmm ?
were you this irritating ?
wow !
excuse me ?
!
oh nothing .
nothing !
just uh , you ve been a little short with me lately .
i m not trying to irritate you .
well then you just must have a natural talent for it .
y know what ?
the doctor will be in soon , why don t we not speak until then .
okay .
seriously , breathe louder ross !
that s great !
y know we should probably ask the doctor if she even knows how to deliver a baby that s half human and half pure evil !
hi dr .
long , how are you ?
oh , you re nice to her .
she has the drugs !
okay .
yeah .
eh , just a tad .
do them !
!
well , we are ready to try anything .
okay .
great !
we will do all of those .
you ve got to be kidding me !
good job joe !
well done !
top notch !
you liked it ?
you really liked it ?
oh ho ho , yeah !
which part exactly ?
the whole thing !
can we go ?
oh no no no , give me some specifics .
i love the specifics , the specifics were the best part !
hey , what about the scene with the kangaroo ?
did did you like that part ?
i was surprised to see a kangaroo in a world war i epic .
you fell asleep !
!
there was no kangaroo !
they didn t take any of my suggestions !
that s for coming buddy .
i ll see you later .
don t go !
i m sorry .
i m so sorry !
look !
this guy fell asleep !
he fell asleep too !
be mad at him !
or , call an ambulance .
hey !
hey .
hi !
what did the doctor say ?
any news on when the baby will come ?
no .
but she did give us some ideas on how to induce labor .
yeah , we tried them all .
we went for a walk , uh we tried a special tea , caster oil , spicy food nothing has worked .
well , there is one thing that we haven t tried , but someone thinks that ,  that will open up a can of worms .
well what is it ?
what is it ?
if it s going to help bring the baby here , like today .
i mean , i think you should do it .
it s sex .
do it !
monica !
i m just saying it s been a really long time for you .
i mean , women have needs .
do it , get yours !
oh i i don t know about that .
no , i think that if the two of you had sex the the the repercussions would be catastrophic .
all right , let s be practical , if ross isn t willing to do it , he s not the only guy in the world you can have sex with .
you can borrow chandler chandler is good !
monica , what is the matter with you ?
nothing .
i just want the baby to be born today .
why ?
why today ?
okay fine !
i keep betting phoebe that you re going to have the baby and i don t want to lose again !
what ?
!
while she s been going through this hell , you ve been making money ?
!
you re betting on your friend staying in this misery ?
!
i ll take that bet .
what ?
!
well , i m miserable here !
i might as well make some money out it !
can i get some of that action ?
wait a minute !
now i m betting against all three of you ?
oh honey , don t worry .
i really do feel like tomorrow s the day .
oh , okay !
hey !
sleeping beauty !

i tried to call you !
i want to talk to you !
i still feel so bad !
oh no , were you upset ?

okay ?
you ve done a lot for me and my career , i wanted to pay you back so i took you to the premiere but you missed it !
okay , so how much do i owe you ?
what ?
!
give me a number , i don t want to owe you anything !
you don t owe me anything , i don t want you money  ah ah ah !

okay , now you got me my first set of head shots .
right , how much were those ?
i don t know , five hundred dollars ?
okay , five hundred dollars .

okay , so that s another five hundred .
five hundred and five hundred , that s   do you want a calculator ?
please !
here !
all right , what else ?
well uh , there was acting classes , stage combat classes , tap classes  which we re still keeping under our hats !
uh then there was that dialect coach who helped you with that play where you needed a southern accent .

!
we know what s going to work !
it s doctor recommended !
i m sorry , but we have to have some boundaries !
my god , i m dying .
oh come on ross , we ve done it before we ll do it again , it ll be a nice way to bookend the pregnancy .
this is insane , i m not going to make love to you just so that you ll go into labor .
make love ?
what are you a girl ?
always a great way to get in a man s pants .
but you will , you will be performing a service .
okay ?
just just think of me as a ketchup bottle , y know you sometimes you have to bang on the end of it just to get something to come out .
i love when you talk dirty to me .
oh , i know it .

you did not like that ?
well , it was not just me , alright ?
he freaked out too !
he could not even undo my bra !
wow , really ?
one time he just looked at my bra and it popped open .
i do not know what is wrong with us , i mean , we have kissed before and that is been great !
but this time it was leading somewhere and i was very aware of the fact that it was joey touching me .
well , you guys have been friends forever .
remember the first time that you kissed ross ?
how weird that was ?
you could not stop laughing ?
you got through that .
ok , that is true .

i have nothing to say to you .
please , monica ?
in the hall ?
well , are not you a treat .
i can not believe you tried to cut me out .
why phoebe , why ?
it was right after we were living together and you were driving me crazy , okay ?
you were really controlling and compulsive and shrill .
I am still all those things !
you are also so generous and kind and scrappy !
i am scrappy .
exactly !
look , no matter what i tried to do , i could not keep you out of my life .
of all the people i have cut out , you were the only one who ever clawed her way back in .
it is because I am scrappy .
yeah , you are .
and I am so glad that you fought your way back in , because i do not know what i would do without you .
i will not know what i would do without you .
well , i guess we should go back in .
when you gave me another chance , i guess we should do the same for amanda .
yeah , i guess you are right .
I am going to stop you right there , glenda .
okay ?
does it look like this is my first time , huh ?
now i want 4 two's .
.
.

difficult ?
i do not know .
that fake british woman is a real bitch , but she sure can dance .
.

really wrong ?
actually , no .
no , it felt right .
you know , it felt like uhm .
.
.
i can not believe we have not been doing this the whole time .
i can tell from your expressions that that is the good news you were hoping for .
.
.
well , I am going to go continue to .
.
.
spread the joy .
well , just because it happened that way for them does not mean it has to happen that way for us .
yeah , yeah .
.
.
absolutely .
i mean , just because something is difficult does not mean that you quit .
right , totally .
yeah , so we just keep trying and trying until we .
.
.
do it .

.
.

i was in the car with nancy all day .
nancy doesn t smoke !
well , at least the perfume is not mine , be thankful for that !
so ?
what do you think of the house ?
it s perfect .
it s everything we ve been looking for .
isn t it ?
then what about the amazing wainscotting and the crown molding and the dormer windows in the attic ?
and the wiggle wharms and the zip zorps ?
what were the things you said ?
don t you love the huge yard ?
and the fireplace in the bedroom .
and nancy said that it is really under price , because the guy lost his job and has to move in with his parents !
this is bringing out a lovely color in you !
so ?
do you think we should get it ?
i don t know .
what do you think ?
i think we should .
i do too .
this is huge !
i know .
how bad you want to smoke , right now .
i don t know what you mean , giant talking cigarette !
oh , by the way , phoebe called just as i was getting into nancy s car , so if she asks you , i was at work all day .
gotcha .
when do we tell them about this ?
we don t .
not until it is a hundred percent .
i mean , why upset everybody over nothing .
okay .
right .
oh my god that is going to be so hard .
i know .
gooooood luck with it .
i just can t see chandler cheating !
i m telling you guys , we followed them out to a house in westchester , the went in for like forty five minutes and then they came out looking pretty happy !
chandler ?
forty five minutes ?
well , something is not right .
i just can t believe he would do this to monica !
i know , and with the baby coming ?
so , should we tell her ?
i don t know .
phoebe , if one of us saw mike with another woman would you want us to tell you ?
why ?
who d you seen him with ?
no one , i m just saying if .
.
.
tell me what you know !
i know nothing !
mike s a great guy , it was hypothetical !
all right .
.
he is a good guy .
you re right , he wouldn t cheat .
believe me , if i did see with someone , there s no way i .
.
.
oh , look at her , so happy !
if only there were a smaller one to clean this one !
hey , is uhm .
.
.
is chandler here ?
no , he s picking up dinner , why , what s up ?
well , look , whatever happens , we re here for you and we love you .
we think chandler might be having an affair .
what ?
phoebe and i saw chandler with a blonde woman today outside on the street and then we followed them to a house in westchester .
they went in together .
so sorry .
oh my god !
oh my god that s awful !
what did you think of the house ?
what ?
monica , you understand what we are saying , right ?
yeah , sure .
.
.
uhm , I am devastated , obviously .
.
.
did you think the neighborhood was homey ?
hey !
you son of a bitch !
is it me , or have the greetings gone downhill around here ?
phoebe and rachel saw you with nancy today and .
.
.
them .
.
.
they think you are having an affair .
who is nancy ?
what is going on ?
ok , alright , you guys , you would better sit down , this is pretty big .
yeah  I am not having an affair .
nancy is our realtor .
i knew he could not be with a woman for 45 minutes !
!
why do you have a realtor ?
uhm , she has been showing us houses outside of the city .
what ?
are you serious ?
when we found out that we are going to get this baby , chandler and i started talking and we decided that we did not want to raise a kid in the city .
so you are going to move ?
oh my god .
should not we all vote on stuff like this ?
!
what is wrong with raising a kid in the city ?
I am doing it , ross is doing it , sarah jessica parker is doing it !
and that is great for you guys , but we want a lawn and a swingset .
.
.
.
and a street where our kids can ride their bikes and maybe an ice cream truck can go by .
so you want to buy a house in the 50's ?
have you thought about what you would be giving up ?
you can not move out of the city , what if you want chinese food at 5am ?
or a fake rolex that breaks as soon as it rains or an asian hooker sent right to your door ?
you know what , if you want to look for a house , that is okay .
no , no , it is not , do not listen to him !
I am going to thump you !
it is ok , because they have to get it out of their system , okay  , but you are going to realize , this is the only place , you want to be .
actually , we already found a house we love .
what ?
and about an hour ago , we made an offer .
bet you wish i was having an affair now , huh ?
you put an offer on a house ?
it is so sweet .
it really is .
it has this big yard that leads down to this stream and then there is these old maple trees .
.
.
wha .
.
?
again with the nature , what are you ?
beavers ?
i know this is really hard and we are really sorry .
is this because i come over here without knocking and eat your food ?
because i can stop doing that ,  i really , really think i can !
you know that is not the reason joe .
we think if you saw it , you would understand .
i mean you guys were there .
it is beautiful , is not it ?
yeah it is .
what the hell are you doin ' ?
well , it is , all right ?
when we were out there today , all i kept thinking was : i can not believe chandler is screwing this woman , but man this would be a nice place to live !
yeah , but so is this .
yeah , i mean , if you moved there , you have to leave here .
i mean , how can you leave this place ?
c'mon daddy , listen to me !
all of my life , everyone has always told me , 'you are a shoe !
you are a shoe , you are a shoe , you are a shoe ! '
.
and today i just stopped and i said , 'what if i do not want to be a shoe ?
what if i want to be a   a purse , y'know ?
or a   or a hat !
no , i do not want you to buy me a hat , I am saying that i am a ha   it is a metaphor , daddy !
you can see where he would have trouble .
well maybe I will just stay here with monica .
well , i guess we have established who is staying here with monica .
.

when i take a shower , she leaves me little notes on the mirror .

i i do , do that .
that s nice .
i like having things to read in the bathroom .
when i fall asleep on the couch after reading , she covers me over with a blanket .

sure !
what the hell is that dog doing here ?
!
little toast here .
i know this is not exactly the kind of thanksgiving that all of you all planned , but for me , this has been really great , you know , i think because it did not involve divorce or projectile vomiting .
anyway , i was just thinking , i mean , if you would gone to vail , and if you guys'd been with your family , if you did not have syphilis and stuff , we would not be all together , you know ?
so i guess what I am trying to say is that I am very thankful that all of your thanksgivings sucked .
and hey , here is to a lousy christmas .
and a crappy new year .
here , here !
you can not move .
you just .
.
.
you just can not .
rachel's right .
this is where you guys belong .
yeah , you do not want to live in westchester .
that is like the worst of the chesters .
you know , sometimes when I am alone in my apartment , i look over here and you guys .
.
.
are just having dinner or .
.
.
watching tv or something , but .
.
.
it makes me feel better .
and now when i look over , who am i going to see ?
the gottliebs , the yangs ?
they do not make me feel so good .
yeah .
so do not move , okay ?
just stay here and .
.
.
maybe close your blinds at night .

we can not afford that .

I am even more sorry that that phone call did not come before i told you about looking through the window .
yeah , we are going to let you be alone .
you are going to be okay ?

you know , I am really sorry i was not more supportive before .
that is okay , we understand .
and about this nancy thing .

I am inputting my numbers , and big al calls me into his office and tells me he wants to make me processing supervisor .
so .
.
.
.
i quit .
why ?
this was supposed to be a temp job !
yeah , chandler .
.
.
you have been there for five years .
if i took this promotion , it would be like admitting that this is what i actually do .
so was it a lot more money ?
it does not matter .
i just do not want to be one of those guys that is in his office until twelve of the clock at night worrying about the wenus .
.
.

i just do not have that much cheffing experience .
unless it is an all toast restaurant .

.
.
.
i love you , ross .
her name is celia .
she is not a bug lady .
she is curator of insects at the museum .
so what are you guys going to do ?
oh , i just thought we could go out to dinner , and then maybe bring her back to my place and I would introduce her to my monkey .
and he is not speaking metaphorically .
so .

back to your place .
you thinking , maybe .
.
.
huh huh ?
well , i do not know .
.
.

huh huh .

but I am hoping  huh huh .
I am telling you , that monkey is a chick magnet !
she is going to take one look at his furry , cute little face and it will seal the deal .
celia , do not worry !
do not scream !
he is not going to hurt you !
soothing tones , celia .
soothing tones !
marcel .

i do not know .
we are talking about whipped fish , monica .
I am just happy I am keeping it down , y'know ?
my god !
what happened to you ?
eight and a half hours of aptitude tests , intelligence tests , personality tests .
.
.
and what do i learn ?
you are ideally suited for a career in data processing for a large multinational corporation .
that is so great !
because you already know how to do that !
can you believe it ?
i mean , do not i seem like somebody who should be doing something really cool ?
you know , i just always pictured myself doing something .
something .
oh chandler , i know , i know .
.
.
oh , hey !
you can see your nipples through this shirt !
here you go , maybe this'll cheer you up .
ooh , you know , i had a grape about five hours ago , so I would better split this with you .

why ?
what what else could it be ?
oh wow , i don t feel well .
i m telling you .
i m telling you .
that s what it is .

she didn t say anything to you ?
maybe it s something you ate ?
please , just just , just go and talk to rachel .

y know , they they always seem to want a little bit more .
i should remember that .
they re kissing let s just go around them .
oh honey , leave them alone , they re in love .

what ?
i got to go find her .
whoa !

maybe we should talk about that for a little while !
it s still looks pretty far !
it s not that far !
just drop !
do not rush me !
!
ross , you should know that my pants are startin  to come down and i m not wearing any underwear !
oww !
!
my ankle !
i really hurt my ankle !
i think i twisted it when i ooh , a quarter !
that really was some of your best work .
hm hmm , i told you !
i can t believe that i ve only got two hours before i call in sick for work .
i have to be up in seven minutes .
well , you re not going to believe this , but if you have seven minutes  really ?
!
do you want to ?
okay !
you get the vacuum cleaner and i ll get the furniture polish !
did you see our bank statement ?
can this be right ?
i know .
god .
i have not seen my savings take a hit like this since i was a kid and they came up with double stuffed oreos .
what happened to all our money ?
I am not sure what they did , but I am inclined to blame enron .
i guess with you doing the internship , we are just spending more than we are bringing in .
maybe i should quit and get a job that pays .
oh , but you are finally doing something that you love !
i can not ask you to give that up .
though it would be nice if the thing that you love was y'know .
.
.
finding gold .
you know what ?
you know what ?
i think we are making too big a deal out of this .
ok ?
so we pay our bills a little late this month and maybe next month we cut back on a few things .
and maybe we start eating out of joey's refrigerator for a change .
you are chef .
.
.
what can you make out of backing soda and beer ?
ok worse case scenario is .
we borrow some money from my parents .
no !
we are not borrowing money .
why not ?
because we do not do that .
we are bings !
and if there is one thing my father taught me was .
.
.
well to always knock before going into the pool house .
.
.
but the other thing was never borrow money .
wow !
i had no idea you had this much pride .
that is right !
i do !
and I am your man .
and I am going to get us through this situation even if it means you working twice as hard .
why ?
?
oh .
you do not have to go , i have something that will fit you .
i want you to stay .
why do not you turn them inside ou .
.
.
I will miss you .
great !
ok .
I will go get the tube top .
wow , mike hannigan .
you sure know how to make a girl say hell yeah !
yeah !
let us do it !
let us live together !
oh god , we are really going to move in together !
I have always wanted to live with a guy .
pick up your socks !
put down the toilet seat !
no !
we are not having sex anymore !
it is going to be fun !
hey joey !
hey !
listen .
i need to know that what I am about to ask you , will never get back to chandler .
I would be lying if i said i have not thought about it myself .
chandler is my best friend , it would be wrong .
good .
.
.
.
but wrong .
ok first of all .
it would be great .
but that is not what I am here to talk to you about .
i need to borrow some money .
aww , i do not know monica y'know .
.
.
erm .
.
.
lending friends money is always a mistake .
but chandler lent you money !
and i think he would tell you it was a mistake .
come on .
i just need it for some rent and  and some other bills .
oh .
how much ?
two thousand dollars ?
two thousand dollars !

joey electrocuted himself again !
huh !
anyway erm , are you going to get a handyman to install this stuff ?

you do not think a woman can do this ?
oh , women can .
you can not .
monica .
would you please tell joey that he is a pig ?
you are a pig .
and you can not do this .

hey you guys !
ok , we have got great news .
i know it is so exciting !
you know I have never lived with a guy before .
well you know it is just like living with a girl .
only they do not steal your makeup .

.
.
.
she is not so cute .
okay , well you put down the toilet seat .
is that a bit you guys do ?

I am just excited to be living with him .
you know i mean , i do not know , can i see someday being married to mike ?

yeah .
y'know  i can picture myself walking down the aisle in a wedding dress that highlights my breasts in an obvious yet classy way .
but do i want that house in connecticut .
you know  near the good schools where mike and i can send sophie and mike junior .
.
oh my god i do .

oh !
wow !
seriously i can not do this .
hey joe !
hey !
listen er  i need to ask you a favor but you can not tell monica anything about it .
i thought you did not have secrets from monica .
and that would have made the official party line .
monica and i are having a little financial trouble .
yeah , i know .
what ?
what do you mean you know ?
err .
.
.
i just figured it out !
you know , i mean you are not working and the economy is bad .

.
i need to borrow some money .
oh !

two thousand dollars ?
yes !
two thousand dollars exactly !
how do you know that !
err .
well i .

err .
.
.
kind of .
i can not believe her !
did she tell you we were having money problems ?
oh no no no no no .
.
.
it was not .
.
.
it was not because of your money problems , it was for something for her .
what ?
something personal .
what would she get for herself for two thousand dollars that she would not tell me about ?
boob job .
i do not want her to get a boob job !
that is crazy !
well it is .
it is not that crazy okay ?
making them smaller , that would be crazy .
oh !
alright .
well i think the reason people laugh is becuase it is a play on the word roomy .
oh no !
no no !
not at all .
we are just moving in right now .
see where it goes .
what do you mean ?
oh .
wow .
was it really that bad ?
ok , well that is bad .
but do not you think it might be different with someone else ?
perhaps a blonde who always uses a toilet .
except for once in the ocean .
but it is just .
.
.
oh !
no !
i definitely do not want to get married .
no i just wanted to make sure you did not want to too .
whew !
coz you know when we move in and you start changing your mind there is going to be hell to pay mister !

and more specifically , i would not want anything to get any bigger .
okay .
.
.
i mean , you would not want any part of me to get any bigger would you ?

just when you thought that dude could not get any wierder .
i know why do you think he was so worried about me getting bigger ?
i do not know !
i mean , what brought that on ?

i thought i was something that we both wanted !
alright look , if it means that much to you , a may be able to get on more with the big boobs .
but the giant ass and the big clown feet ?

with the blood and the screaming and the little present that is shooting out of her !

because she is !
joey , chandler knows i borrowed the money .

yeah coz the more i thought about it , the more i realised i do not think marriage is neccessarily the right path for you .
what do you mean ?
well , i know the other day in the coffeehouse you were caught up in the whole soccer mom thing ?
but is that really you ?
i mean can you honestly picture yourself in a volvo ?
they are awfully boxy .
.
.
i do not know you would be so bored with marriage .
i mean it is so .
.
.
normal .
uh huh .
hey hey , can i help ?

we er  climbed up four flights of stairs , manueveored a narrow hallway , dodged a rabid pitbul .
.
.
but these last three feet are where it gets really tricky .
you know sometimes your words .
.
.
they hurt .
hey uh , where do you guys want this ?
yeah , seriously coz this is really heavy .
i mean not for me because I am only pretending to hold this , but for these guys .
just one last time erm .

someday .
aaaaand .
.
.
.
.
.
.
hernia .

because i just did not know how much i wanted it .
and i love you , and i wanted to live with you .
but i do not think i can !
it was ok to move in when i did not know what was going to happen , but i can not move in knowing that nothing is ever going to happen .

me neither .
i think i need to be with someone who wants what i want .
i do not want it to end either .

!
!
that is great !
hey , can you cast me in it ?
oh .
.
.
i do not know , i really do not think you are right for the part .
what do you mean ?
i can do anything , I am a chameleon !
huh ?
I am old !
I am tired !
hey , I am hot  I am cold !
!
huh ?
?
come on !
what can not i do ?
first of all .
bravo .
uh , but i really do not think you are right for this .
the part calls for a stuffy college professor .
i can do that !
hello , I am your professor .
when I am not busy thinking of important things or .
.
.
professing .
i like to use .
.
.
oh , what is the product ?
software that facilitates inter business networking e solutions ?
I am cold !
hey !
guess who is a finalist for a huge research grant !
I will give you a hint , he is looking right at you .
oh , I am so excited , i mean , apparently i beat out hundreds of other applicants , included five guys i went to graduate school with .
not that I am keeping score or anything .
.
.
five !
well , ok , it is for 25 thousand dollars .
and if i get it , I will finally be able to complete my field research !
and there will be an article about me in the paleontology review  !
yeah !
that will be the first time my name is in there , without people raising serious questions about my work !
yeah .
why ?
your ex boyfriend ?
so , your ex boyfriend is going to determine if your new boyfriend gets this grant ?
wow , your new boyfriend is screwed !
well , if you think it would help .
ok , now , is there anything i can do to .
.
.
you know , butter him up ?
anything he really likes ?
we will see how dinner goes .
hey !
hey , you want to go to see a movie ?
well , i told you i had to spend all the day clearing out stuff , so mike could move in .
oh , right .
yeah .
oh , well .
now that I am here i might as well help you with the cleaning and organizing !
just happen to have my label maker !
oh , it is so hard to get rid of stuff !
did you and chandler have to make compromises when you first moved in together ?
uh , chandler did !
what does he want you to give up ?
a bunch of stuff .
and the worst one .
.
.
he wants me to get rid of gladys .
who is gladys ?
oh !
what a tragic loss !
yeah .
i really hate to give her up .
oh , i know !
!
oh , you should take her !
well , i i i i .
.
.
i do not know .
.
.
why , you do not like her ?
well , of course i do .
what is not to like !
I will take her in a minute !
but , you know , i think that you are giving up too easy , honey .
i think that you need to fight for her !
really ?
you think ?
absolutely !
yes , you say to him I am sorry mike i can not live without her , she means too much to me !
ok , I will fight for her .
ok !
oh , wait , oh i just realized .
.
.
if i do that , that means you do not get her .
damn it , i did not think this through !
hey you guys .
hi !
oh !
any word on casting yet ?
joe , i told you , you are just not right for the part .
what do you mean ?
rach , do not i seem like a professor you would buy some kind of e crap from ?
I am sorry , this sounds like something I am never going to be interested in .
joe .
.
.
just watch it , and if you do not like it , you do not pass it on to your bosses !
fine !
thank you .
work , joe !
damn it !
just pass it to your boss !
he is not right for the part .
so if i suggest him , my bosses are going to think I am an idiot !
and that is something they should learn on their own !
just tell joey that you watched the tape and you liked it , but your bosses did not .
then that way , you are the good guy and they are the bad guys .
that is good !
i liked it , they did not .
joey , for god's sake , go to work !
.
i can not believe I am about to meet benjamin hobart .
I have always thought of him as one of the people I would invite to my fantasy dinner party .
do you think there is any chance he will bring christie brinkley or c3po ?
well , i .
.
.
i am having a good hair day .
I am ok .
it is an honor to meet you .
i can not tell you how long I have been an admirer of your work , i mean , that nobel prize ,  whoooo !
i mean , i have to tell you that , you are one of the reasons i got into the field .
no , but , it is , you know , it is just a funny image , you know , the two of you , in this restaurant , with .
.
.
tzz zzz , mmm .
ok well , i would like to do a dig in the painted desert .
see , there are still several areas that have not been fully excavated .

kind of inappropriate , do not you think ?
are you serious ?
no !
hi !
sorry , I am late .
hey , how did it go with mike , is he going to let you keep the painting ?
no , he really hates it .
but he is going to let me keep my box of human hair !
so you got to pick your battles .
but the good news is , gladys is yours !
wow , what is the bad news !
who is gladys ?
oh , she is that work of art i made , you know , with the woman coming out of the frame .
oh , and monica gets to keep her ?
in her house ?
i am so jealous !
oh , i did not know you wanted her too !
huh !
well , i mean , sure , of course .
but .
.
.
you already gave that to monica , so .
.
.
you know , i would give her up , for you .
no , i could not let you do that .
but i want to .
but i do not want you to .
but i insist !
but i insist harder !
girls , girls , stop , ok ?
we will flip a coin .
heads , she is rachel's , tails she is monica's .

you won fair and square .
I am so sad !

ross was in love with rachel since , you know , forever , but every time he tried to tell her , something kind of got in the way , like cats , and italian guys .
finally chandler was like forget about her  but when ross was in china on his dig , chandler let it slip that ross was in love with rachel .
she was like , oh my god .
so she went to the airport to meet him when he came back , but what she did not know was , that ross was getting off the plane with another woman .
uh oh !
so , that is pretty much everything you need to know .
but , enough about us .

you know whose voice that was ?

it was you , pal .
well , maybe it was god , doing me .
look , you were right .
she looks at me and sees a friend , that is all .

go go go go , come on !
so uh , what did you find out ?
he said .
he said , he said that they are having a great time .
I am sorry .
but , the silver lining , if you want to see it , is that he made the decision all by himself !
without any outside help whatsoever .
how is that the silver lining ?
you have to really want to see it .
ironically , these are the guys who were picked last in gym .
pheebes , you know what I am thinking ?
oh , ok .
how , it is been so long since you have had sex , you are wondering if they have changed it ?
no , although now that is what I am thinking .
all right , so what were you thinking ?
well , i was thinking , that you gave the guys such great haircuts , i thought , maybe you would like to do mine ?
ohh !
no .
why not ?
because , I am just , I am incredibly anal and an unbelievable control freak .
no you are not .
i know I am not , but you are , and i was trying to spare your feelings .

rachel , how did this happen ?
i do not know , i just kind of ran into him last night .
where ?
at his apartment .
is this juice ?
whoa , whoa .
and the fact that you dumped him because he hit on phoebe ?
oh god , i know I am a pathetic loser .
honey , you are not pathetic , you are sad .
people do stupid things when they are upset .
my god , if i had a nickel for every guy i wish i had not .
.
.
, but this is about your horrible mistake .
hi .
sorry we are late but we were well , there was touching .
hey , paulo .
what are you doing here ?
so , uh , he is back .
yeah , he is back .
is that a problem ?
no , not a problem .
good !
I am glad it is not a problem .
ok , you are going to have to not touch my ass .
well , in spite of the yummy bagels and palpable tension , I have got pants that need to be altered .
hey , chandler , when you see frankie , tell him joey tribbiani says hello .
he will know what it means .
are you sure he is going to be able to crack that code ?
you know it is funny , the last time paulo was here , my hair was so much shorter and cuter .
all right .
ok , but , but !
you have to promise that you will not be all like control y and bossy and monica about it .
i promise .
all right .
now some of you are going to get cut , and some of you are not .
but i promise none of you are going to feel a thing .
all right , that is it , i quit .
what ?
i did not say anything .
yeah , but this  is not the face of a person who trusts a person .
ok , this  is the face of a person who , you know , does not trust a person .
I am sorry .
I am sorry , phoebe .
it is just a little shorter than what we had discussed .
would you relax ?
i know what i am doing .
this is how he wears it .
how who wears it ?
demi moore .
demi moore is not a he .
well , he was a he in arthur , and in ten .
that is dudley moore .
i said i wanted it like demi moore .
oh .
oh !
oh my god !
oh my god !
oh my god !
oh my god !
I am sorry , I am sorry .
which one's demi moore ?
she is the actress that was in disclosure , indecent proposal , ghost !
oh , she is got gorgeous hair .
i know !
at least as long as i have the pants .
how is she ?
it is too soon to tell .
she is resting , which is a good sign .
how is the hair ?
I am not going to lie to you , ross , it does not look good .
i put a clip on one side , which seems to have stopped the curling .
can we see her ?
your hair looks too good , i think it would upset her .
ross , why do not you come on in .
yeah .
how are you doing ?
I am okay .
ooh , that bad , huh ?
what ?
look , i can sense when women are depressed and vulnerable .
it is one of my gifts .
when i saw him get off that plane with her , i really thought i hit rock bottom .
but today , it is like there is rock bottom , 50 feet of crap , then me .
you got to tell ross how you feel .
come on .
how can i just tell him ?
what about julie ?
what about her ?
they have only been going out for two weeks .
ross has been in love with you for like 10 years .
i do not know , i do not know .
look , rach , rach !
I have been with my share of women .
in fact , I have been with like a lot of people's share of women .
the point is , I have never felt about anyone the way ross felt about you .
yo , paisan !
can i talk to you for a sec ?
your tailor is a very bad man !
frankie ?
what are you talking about ?
hey , what is goin ' on ?
joey's tailor .
took advantage of me .
what ?
no way .
I have been going to the guy for 12 years .
oh come on !
he said he was going to do my inseam , and he ran his hand up my leg , and then , there was definite .
.
.
what ?
cupping .
that is how they do pants !
first they go up one side , they move it over , then they go up the other side , they move it back , and then they do the rear .
what ?
ross , ross , would you tell him ?
is not that how they measure pants ?
yes , yes it is .
in prison !
whatsa matter with you ?
what ?
that is not ?
oh my god .
even mary tyler moore would have been better .
i like it .
i do , i think it is a ten .
thank you .
my hair is very amused .
come on , monica , things could be worse .
you could get caught between the moon and new york city .
i know it is crazy , but it is true .
thank you .
well , i got to go .
bye .
bye , rach .
wait , are you leaving ?
yeah , that is kind of what i meant by bye !
well , can i talk to you for a sec ?
okay .
hey , when the doctor does that hernia test .
.
.
that is ok .
what is goin ' on ?
well , first of all , paulo and i are not back together .
it was just a stupid thing i did , and if i could go back in time and do it again , well , i would not .
um , second of all  , what ?
ok .
well , before i say anything , i just need to know , is this one of those things where you break up with a guy , and then i tell you what i think , and then the next day you get back together with the guy , and i look like a complete idiot ?
no .
no no no no .
well , then , i think , i think the guy is scum .
i hate him .
i mean i actually i i physically hate him .
i always have .
you are way too good to be with a guy like that .
really ?
you deserve to be with someone who appreciates you , and who gets how funny and sweet and amazing , and adorable , and sexy you are , you know ?
someone who wakes up every morning thinking oh my god , I am with rachel  .
you know , someone who makes you feel good , the way i am with julie .
was there a second of all ?
no , i think that was the whole all .
okay .
okay .
okay .
i swear to god , dad .
that is not how they measure pants .
oh yeah !
oh , i can do that .
you want to do it right now ?
ok , i just want to be really sure this time .
andie mcdowell's the girl from four weddings and a funeral , right ?
no .
no no no no no .
that is rodney mcdowell .
andie mcdowell is the guy from planet of the apes .
oh , yeah .
ok , thank you .
you are welcome .

two more apples .
we are four short of a bush of  .
god i feel so alive , i love being in the country !
i also got this great salt and pepper shaker from the restaurant .
oh , that is not cool .
no , chandler , you have to find the line between stealing and taking what the hotel owes you .
for example : hair drier , no , no , no , but shampoo and conditioners , yes , yes , yes .
now , the salt shaker is off limits , but the salt  i wish I would thought this through .
i think i know what you mean though .
the lamp is the hotel's , but the bulbs  .
oh , you already got that .
not my first time in a hotel , my friend .
ok , how about this  ?
no , no , no , you can not take the remote control !
yes , but the batteries .
.
.
thank you , thank you very much !
let us celebrate with some maple candy !
no !
at least tell me where you hid it .
can i ask you a question ?
yeah .
have you ever had any weird romantic dreams ?
let me think .
oh , when i was younger i used to dream that i got married to mayor mccheese , and on our wedding night i ate his head .
ok , well this is like that .
in no way .
i had a .
i had a dream last night that i wanted to kiss joey .
wow , do you mean like kiss him kiss him ?
oh yeah !
i mean , that was pretty intense .
what do you think brought than on ?
i do not know !
i mean , maybe that is something to do with the fact that i saw him do a love scene yesterday .
a love scene ?
with who ?
olivia .
olivia ?
i thought she was marrying connor !
oh right , real life more important .
so do you think that my dream means anything ?
i do not know .
i mean , you saw him do a love scene , so maybe you do not have a thing for joey , maybe you have a thing for drake .
ah !
well it was joey reading drake's lines in the dream .
.
.
of course it was !
trust me , when it comes to psychology i know what I am talking about .
i took two psych classes in college .
you took the same class twice .
it was hard !
hey !
here , monica , look what i got to wear when i play at the restaurant  uh , huh wait !
right ?
i mean , this might even class up the ballad of the uncircumcised man .
oh .
phoebe ?
maybe i was not clear before .
i really love listening to your music here , but my restaurant is sort of an upscale place .
right , yeah , ok , I will ask the butler to fetch my diamonds out of the vault .
phoebe , it is not what you wear .
it is sort of your songs .
.
.
i just do not think you should play at the restaurant anymore .
oh , ok .
fine , I will just , I will take the hat back  .
hey , so you guys , the funniest thing happened , at work .
.
.
my songs are not good enough for your restaurant ?
ok , we are still on that .
i did not say your songs were not good enough .
then what is wrong with them ?
would they not go with your tiny portions of pretentious food ?
tiny portions ?
yeah well , excuse me , i ordered the smoked salmon appetizer , but  i can not see it , i can not see it  !
phoebe , it is not about quantity .
well .
it is not about quality .
oh really , you want to talk about quality ?
have you heard of a key ?
it is what some people sing in .
well at least all my songs do not taste like garlic .
yeah , there are other ingredients monica .
ok , so that is what we are doing .
you know , when I am in the coffee house bopping along to one of your songs , I am wearing ear plugs .
ear plugs , or cloves of garlic ?
you know what ?
i take back what i said before .
you keep playing at the restaurant , because with your music driving people inside , my bar sales are going up like crazy .
what are people having , the garlic martini ?
oh we did , and you still have all your lamps .
oh , i did not factor in the room tax .
oh dude , do not worry about it , i found an unattended maid's car .
we are way ahead of the game .
oh my god .
what ?
there is something new in the bowl .
look , we have enough , just walk away .
no , but i want .
i want the pinecones !
there is a forest right outside .
it is not the same .
ok , go quick !
thank you for a delightful stay .
oh , my maple candy !
food here at 'javu '  will kill you  the food here at 'javu '  .
will kill you .
.
thank god , it is just you !
i thought someone was swinging a bag of cats against the wall .
you would better get back in that kitchen monica , the garlic is not going to overuse itself .
ok , you have to stop playing now .
why ?
the only person my playing is bothering is you !
oh yeah ?
ok , let us settle this , come on !
get your garlic peelers off me !
excuse me , excuse me , hi , I am monica geller  I am the head chef here .
.
.
.
ok , i was actually expecting a little applause there , but whatever !
ok , quick question : by a show of hands , how many of you were bothered by this woman's singing outside ?
ok , ok , how many of you enjoyed the music outside ?
ha !
alright , let me ask you this question : how many of you thought the music was fine , but not in keeping with the tone of the restaurant ?
.
ok , well , who identified the tone of this restaurant as pretentious comma garlicky ?
ok who thinks the food is delicious and a little pretention never hurt anyone ?
ok , well , alright , who thinks the food is fine , the music was fine , but your evening was ruined by this incessant poll taking ?
.
excuse us !
alright here is a question : who was so worried about her restaurant being fancy that she made a big deal about her friend playing her music and feels really bad about it now ?
oh .
who was so stupid and stubborn that she lashed out against her friend's cooking which she actually thinks is pretty great !
I am sorry .
.
.
I am sorry too .
.
.
ooohh .
.
.
hey !
want to stick around and I will whip you up some dinner ?
yeah !
as long as it is free !
food here is ridiculously over p .
.
.
who is hoping the hand raising thing is still cute enough that you will not hate me ?
hey !
hey !
joey , do you have peanut butter on the back of your head ?
oh man !
i thought i got it all !
how .
how .
.
.
?
i was making a peanut butter smoothy , right ?
uh huh and i could not find this little plastic thing  that goes on top of the blender .
and i thought .
well .
.
.
how important can that be , right .
.
.
?
turns out very !
wow .
definitely just drake .
.
.
what ?
what .
how is it going with drake ?
oh .
i do not think it is going very well .
.
.
what .
that scene i saw was so good !
well , I am feeling really insecure about the one we are shooting tomorrow .
.
.
joey , is this that thing that you do when you say you are bad so I will give you a compliment ?
a little .
yeah no , i really am worried , you know , i mean i have to make it convincing that I am in love with olivia .
so ?
so .
I have never played that !
ooh !
honey , it can not be that hard , i mean , you have been in love before ?
uh .
well .
just once .
with you .
.
.
ok .
this could be a little awkward .
I am just going to blow past it .
.
.
well can not you just use that method actor thing where you use your real life memories to help you in your performance ?
what the hell are you talking about ?
?
alright , alright look , just uh .
.
.
just try to remember how you felt when you were in love , and think about that when you are playing the scene .
oh !
ok , yeah , i think i can do that .
yeah ok , there is this party scene coming up .
.
and olivia and her husband are there and all drake wants to do is grab her and kiss her , but he can not .
.
.
and that makes me think about all those times when i wanted to grab you and kiss you , but you did not know so i would just pretend everything was cool , but really , it was killing me .
joey , you never  you never talked about that before .
.
.
well .
.
hey , you know what else i could use ?
there is a scene where drake sneaks into olivia's bedroom , and she does not know he is there    which never happened with us !
and he knows he should not be there , but he just wants to look at her .
.
.
you know ?
and i remember all those mornings before you even put on your make up , when i would think to myself , my god , she .
is .
.
.
beautiful .
.
.
and it hurts so much , cuz i knew i could never tell you  but it was worth it just to be there looking at you .

hey everybody !
happy thanksgiving !
no , no , no .
no no no .
what , are we keeping thanksgiving a secret this year ?
no , we are playing this game i learned at work .
you have to name all the states in six minutes .
what ?
that is like insanely easy !
now , that is a lot harder than it sounds .
you always forget at least one , or in some cases .
.
.
fourteen  .
it is a stupid game and i was not playing against other people , so technically i did not lose .
what ?
you forgot fourteen states ?
nobody cares about the dakotas .
oh , okay , time's up !
all right , i got 48 .
oh that is not bad , pheebs ?
oh , i got tired of naming states .
so i decided to list the types of celery , and i have one : regular celery .
okay , so rachel's got 48 and phoebe has the lead in vegetables , joey ?
say hello to the new champ of chandler's dumb states game .
wow , how many have you got ?
fifty six !
hey !
how is new england not a state ?
huh ?
they have a sports team !
does south oregon have a sports team ?
there you go .
how come we have one extra place setting ?
because you invited your assistant .
oh , right .
sorry .
but tag's not coming ; his girlfriend came into town , so he is spending thanksgiving with her .
oh !
why did not you tell me ?
i made him his own individual sweet potato stuffed pumpkin .
well , i was going to , but then i figured , you know .
.
.
you are food is so delicious and perfect , you can never have too many of those pumpkin things .
now you think i would not enjoy that , because it is so fake ,  but i still do .
regular celery !
oh , i already have that .
done !
with time a to spare .
oooh that may be a new world's record  you know , i hate to lecture you guys , but it is kind of disgraceful , that a group of well educated adults and joey can not name all the states .
did you ever see a map , or one of those round , colorful things called a globe ?
hmm ?
uh , magellan ?
you got 46 states .
what ?
that is impossible .
46 .
wow !
who is well educated now , mr .
i forgot ten states ?
all right , I am out of oven space .
I am going to turn on joey's .
please , watch him !
do not let joey eat any of the food !
i am only one man !
okay ross , time is up !
no , just give me another minute .
look ross , if you do not know them by now , you will never know them , okay ?
that is the beauty of this game .
it makes you want to kill yourself .
this this is crazy !
i can do this !
all right , uhh , i bet i can get all 50 before dinner .
okay , but if you can not no dinner !
you are on !
all right .
do not look at my list , ross , because there is a lot on there that you do not have .
hey , did you guys know , that your oven does not work ?
but the drawer full of take out menus is okay , right ?
ross , I am going to use yours , okay ?
pshhshhh !
chandler ?
can you give me a hand ?
sure , and joey ; do not let ross look at any of the maps or the globe in your apartment .
do not worry , chandler , it is not a globe of the united states .
hey you guys I am going to go out and take a walk .
phoebe , why is your bag moving ?
oh , it is not !
seriously , it is moving !
what the hell is in there ?
it is just my knitting that is all !
yes !
i knit this .
I am very good .
ross s apartment is nice !
how come we do not hang out here more often ?
i do not know .
maybe it is because it smells a little weird .
it is like old pumpkins or something .
that is my pie !
which smells delicious !
uh oh !
uh oh !
what ?
we left joey alone with the food !
yep !
yep , i knew it !
there he is .
.
.
feeding stuffing to a dog !
hi geller bing residence .
how can i help ?
phoebe , why is there a dog in our apartment ?
I am sorry , who is this ?
phoebe , there is a dog sitting on my couch !
tell her , I am allergic , and i will sue !
no , there is no dog here ?
yes there is !
he is black and white and shaggy and [cut to monica s apartment ] he is sitting next to rachel and licking rachel's hand .
oh my god !
where are you ?
I will be right there !
they are here already ?
how are they doing this ?
hi tag !
what are you doing here ?
well , sure !
come in !
well , what what happened to your girlfriend ?
oh , I am sorry .
ohio !
!
thank you !
huh !
where is the dog ?
!
what dog ?
there there is no dog here .
yeah that dog left !
phoebe !
phoebe , open up !
there is no dog in here .
phoebe , we can hear the dog barking !
no that is just me coughing !
oh , good , there you are !
listen , um , i have a dog in my room .
what is it doing here ?
well , I am watching it for some friends who went out of town .
wait .
hello , my name is clunkers .
may i please stay with you nice people ?
oooh , i wish she could stay here , but chandler is allergic !
extremely allergic , okay ?
if I am anywhere near a dog for more than 5 minutes , my throat will just close up !
that is odd , because this dog's been living here for the past 3 days  really ?
chandler , if that dog's been here that long , and you have not had a reaction , maybe you are not allergic to this dog ?
well , it still has to go , right ?
okay , it is um   do not do it !
do not do what ?
i have to !
okay ?
it is time !
okay , i hate dogs .
are you crazy ?
are you out of your mind ?
why ?
told ya .
they are needy , they are jumpy , and you can not tell what they are thinking , and that scares me a little bit .
right , they are scary .
ahh , she just ate a treat out of my hand !
!
!
wait a minute .
do you not like all dogs ?
i mean , not even puppies ?
is there a puppy here ?
okay , you are new !
look , chandler , i told you , never tell anyone about this dog thing .
it is like ross not likin  ice cream .
you do not like ice cream ?
it is too cold .
okay , it is just that dogs make me a little uncomfortable .
it hurts my teeth .
and i do not want to say this , i do not you guys to hate me , but uh , i do not think , i can be around that dog anymore .
okay , so either the dog goes , or i go .
oh my god !
!
how can i not get this ?
I am a college professor ; i got 1450 on my s.a.t.s .
1250 .
damn , i forgot you were here .
all right .
we are going to take clunkers to ross s .
we will be back in a minute .
oh , wait before you guys go , can i just ask you a question ?
yeah .
when a guy breaks up with his girlfriend , what is an appropriate amount of time to wait before you make a move ?
oh , I would say about a month .
really ?
I would say 3 to 4 .
half hour .
interesting .
when it is your assistant , i would say never .
all right , rach , the big question is , does he like you ?
all right ?
because if he does not like you , this is all a moo point .
huh .
a moo point ?
yeah , it is like a cow's opinion .
it just does not matter .
it is moo .
have i been living with him for too long , or did that all just make sense ?
please , do not listen to joey , okay .
would you look at him ?
he he s obviously depressed .
he is away from his family ; he is spending thanksgiving with strangers .
what he needs right now is for you to be his friend .
you are right , I am sorry .
thank you .
okay , that is what I am going to do .
fine !
take their advice .
no one ever listens to me .
when the package is this pretty , no one cares what is inside .
hey !
how are you holding up ?
yeah ?
I am sorry about your girlfriend .
so were you guys together a long time ?
now that she broke up with you ?
yeah .
hmmmm .
no yeah , all the time , constantly .
it is terrifying .
but you know that i figure it it has to work out .
because , uh it has to .
yeah , i know , i do .
i really do .
well , what is a boss for ?
hug it out !
all right , he likes you back !
huh ?
told ya , you should go for it !
street noise drowned any of that out ?
no , all right , i see you later , okay .
.
.
uh , yeah , well , see , he  joey knows , that I am I am very insecure about my back and , and you are hugging me , so obviously you are not repulsed by it , yeah !
no ?
all right , here is the truth um , joey said what he said , because um , I am attracted to you .
yeah , i admit it .
i have a crush on you , and uh , and , and i know that is crazy because we work together , and and nothing could ever happen , and the last thing i want to do is is to freak you out or make you feel uncomfortable .
which is why it would be really great if you said something right about now .
what ?
okay , that is going to take them a minute .
do you have anything else you want to get off your chest ?
wait , we still have time to talk and they re they are not even in the car yet !
oh look , there they go , okay .
okay phoebe , we should probably go back now .
please do not leave me , I will be lonely .
stop it .
stop !
okay let us go .
we can be strong .
yeah , okay .
oh my god !
did you hear that ?
she said monica !
oooh , i can not leave her !
you know if you want , we can sneak the dog back in and chandler would not even know .
that is not going to work .
I have had that dog there for three days and chandler had no idea .
he is not so smart .
hey !
i did not know either .
yeah , but you kind of knew that something was going on , did not you ?
yeah , i knew .
where is chandler ?
here i am .
wash your hands !
!
!
how did you know ?
hey !
what is she doing back here ?
relax , ross .
she is not made of ice cream !
hey look , phoebe .
i , uh , i laid out the states geographically .
.
.
no , no , we do not really have time for this right now .
okay , we have to keep chandler away from my bedroom .
yeah , but , but look what I am .
.
.
see , this is exactly what we do not have time for .
where is monica ?
um , in phoebe's room .
you can not go in there .
why not ?
monica's crying .
she is very upset about this whole clunkers thing .
well , i , i should go in there .
no .
no , no .
she does not want to see you right now .
why not ?
because you sent away the dog !
this is ridiculous .
oh , is it ?
is it ?
look , when monica and i were kids , we had a dog named rover .
and , uh , one day , my dad decides , he does not like dogs .
so monica and her friend phyllis take away the dog .
and that was the last time we ever saw him .
do not you see ?
this is just like that .
only with a few details changed .
okay , I am in my sweat pants .
bring on the food !
what is the matter ?
monica's all upset , because i sent clunkers away .
so ?
bring the dog back , you are a hero .
yeah , i can be a hero , i could do that .
i could , i could do .
.
.
i , w w what if , what if it attacks me ?
chandler , it is like a big gerbil .
and that does not scare you ?
ross , you need some help ?
from you ?
yes , please !
first of all , utah ?
dude , you can not just make stuff up !
i hate america !
when i finish this game , i swear i am moving .
hey !
tag's still talking to the police .
yeah , ohh !
why , damnit , why did i open my mouth ?
i have a crush on you ; i am attracted to you .
gee , i i know that i freaked him out if you said it like that , you probably did , yeah .
hey , is chandler here ?
no , no he went for a walk .
okay , but you cannot tell him .
.
.
but look whose back !
hi !
oh no no no no no no no !
he went over to ross ' to bring the dog back here !
oh no , the dog's not going to be there !
you think ?
hi , honey .
please , please , please , do not be mad at me .
what ?
why , why would .
.
.
shh , wait and see .
maybe we will , maybe we will not .
okay , i went over to ross ' apartment to bring back clunkers .
y know , for you , and  i left the door open and she must have gotten out and i looked everywhere , all over the apartment , including the roof , which fyi ross , one of your neighbors , growing weed .
i could not find him , and i am so , so , so , sorry .
but i do know where we could all go ease the pain .
we have good news , look whose back !
hi !
clunkers ?
!
oh my god !
that is right , she came back all by herself .
it is a thanksgiving miracle !
it is so good to see you !
yeah , she came all the way back from ross ' building .
oh , the things she must have seen !
and then she climbed up the fire escape and she tapped on the window with her teeny little paw and then we ran to let her in  i went to far , did not i ?
when should i have stopped ?
okay , maybe this is so hard , because there are not 50 states .
let me tell you something , i have 49 states , and there are no more !
i i think , i should be able to eat something .
it is up to you .
oh , hi !
how are you doing ?
oh .
tag ?
y you are going ?
uh we did not , uh we did not get the chance to talk .
uh , so , where did you say you are from again ?
ah , what good are you .
look , um , i think we should talk about what happened on the terrace .
ah , i i never should have said what i said .
it y know what ?
it just does not matter how i feel .
i mean we work together , so nothing could really ever happen between us , and what i would love is just to go to work on monday , and and never talk about this again , okay ?
big day monday lots to do .
so , we are okay ?
oh , god , i know it , that i freaked you out .

phoebe , i bet somebody is missing that badge .
yeah , i should probably take it back .

what is going on with you ?
nothing !
oh , come on !
you have been acting strange all day !
all right !
there is something .
i kind of had a dream ,  but i do not want to talk about it .
whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa what what if martin luther king had said that ?
i kind of have a dream !
i don t want to talk about it .
well , it involved monica .
you had a dream about a girl that i am seeing ?
!
oh , that is so cool !
i can not tell you how many times I have dreamt about a girl that he was seeing .
anyway we are talking about your dream .
i love you .
your dream ?
do not worry , there was not any sex in it or anything .
i have not dreamt about her like that since i found out about you two   ish .
what was the dream about ?
well , okay .
you were my girlfriend and we were doing the crossword puzzle .
y'know like you guys were doing last night .
so , that is it .
I am in love with monica and I will be moving out .
wait , joey !
joey !
that doesn t mean that that you are in love with me !
it it doesn t ?
no !
no , it can mean anything .
like uh , all of the sudden you are jealous because I have become the apartment stud .
that kind of sounds like your dream dude .
or , it could mean that that you saw chandler and me together and we y'know were being close and stuff and then you just want to have that with someone too .
in the dream i did enjoy the closeness .
um hmm .
joey , look , are you attracted to monica ?
right here , right now , are you attracted to her ?
not really .
well there you have it !
well sure !
I am just wearing sweats !
but that is good that you are not in love with me , because you just want a girlfriend !
no , i do not think it is just about just getting a girlfriend .
y'know ?
i mean , yeah , i can get a girlfriend !
yeah , we could sit in the chair and do crosswords , but y'know are we ever going to have y'know the closeness like like you guys have ?
well y'know , monica and i were friends before we started dating .
so maybe maybe that is it ?
friends first ?
that is interesting .
you become friends after ?
no , never done that either .
hey , umm , do you guys have that tape measure ?
oh yeah , it is actually in my bedroom .
that is right .
what is up joey ?
how you doin ' ?
excuse me , is this your car ?
well i do not think it is very nice of you to park here , y'know you are blocking the entrance .
well , it is a problem for me , which means it is a problem for you because I am a cop .
ohh , no .
oh okay , so you are a cop which means you can park anywhere , because i know that because I am a cop too .
so , all right , keep up the good work .
10 4 .
i I am with the umm , the 57th .
I am in vice .
yeah , in fact I am undercover right now .
I am a who are .
umm , do you know , umm sipowicz ?
yeah , big guy , kind of bald .
don t try to call him or anything , because he is not there , he is out .
his umm , his partner just died .
i i sure will , take care .
oh .
hey !
joey , would you mind giving me and ross a hand moving his couch ?
oh , I would love too , but i got acting class .
but y'know what ?
i guess i can blow that off ,  for you .
thanks !
uh , hey , rach let me ask you something .
uh , i was just over there talking to monica and chandler , boy they are really tight .
i know .
yeah that is not such a bad situation they got going over there .
I am thinking of getting me one of those .
what is up joe ?
well , the reason i think monica and chandler are so great  yeah ?
is because they were friends first .
y'know ?
so i asked myself , who are my friends ?
you and phoebe , and i saw you first .
so   what are you saying ?
I am saying maybe you and i crank it up a notch .
y'know honey , umm , as uh , as flattered as i am that uh , you saw me first , uhh , i just , i i do not think we should be cranking anything up .
I will treat you real nice .
yeah , well , y'know umm  no honey , listen i think it is a great idea to become friends with someone before you date them , but i think the way you do it is y'know you meet someone , become their friend , build a foundation , then you ask them out on a date .
do not hit on your existing friends !
will not will not that take longer ?
yeah .
yeah .
oh , but once you find it , ohh it is so worth the wait .
yeah .
i understand .
i understand .
man , i wish i saw phoebe first !
come here to me .
no no , you come here to me .
hey ross !
i brought reinforcements .
oh great !
what , you brought joey ?
well , i brought the next best thing .
hey !
chandler ?
!
you brought chandler ?
!
the next best thing would be monica !
y'know , i would be offended , but monica is freakishly strong , so  look , i i drew a sketch about how we are going to do it .
okay rach ,  that is you .
that is the couch .
whoa oh , what is what is that ?
oh , that is me .
wow !
you certainly think a lot of yourself .
no !

hey !
hey !
how is it going ?
did you make any new friends ?
yeah , yeah , i met this woman .
hey , whoa whoa !
what is she like ?
uhh , well , she is really good in bed .
joey , i thought you were going to try to be friends first !
well look , hey , it is all your fault !
what ?
!
why ?
!
well because you did not give me advice !
no !
you gave me a pickup line !
as soon as i told her i wanted to y'know , build a foundation and be friends first .
i suddenly , through no fault of my own , became irresistible to her !
and her roommate !
what about the closeness ?
closeness shmoshness !
there was three of us for crying out loud !
all right !
hey , who wants pizza ?
!
ooh , i do !

he found me !
oh my god , phoebe , are you going to go to jail ?
!
well , if I am going down , I am taking you  with me .
harboring a fugitive ?
that is one to three years minimum .
good luck chandler .
okay , you can arrest me .
fine .
but you will never make it stick and you know it !
yep !
as long as you understand that I am going to call my lawyer and once he puts you on the stand he will make you look like a fool .

i can not believe you did that .
yeah , well .

it s just going to be too hard .
y know ?
i mean , it s ross .
how can i watch him get married ?
y know it s just , it s for the best , y know it is , it s  y know , plus , somebody s got to stay here with phoebe !
y know she s going to be pretty big by then , and she needs someone to help her tie her shoes ; drive her to the hospital in case she goes into labour .
you don t have a car .
and your license expired .
i know .
yeah , see , there s so much to do and i have so little time to do it in .
all right , check it out .
check this out .
it says here that there s a place you can go to rent videos of all the museums !
it s almost as good as being there .
it s better !
you can t go to a museum in your underwear !
well , you could , but .
.
.
probably just the one time .
i bet we could get videos of all the sites , get a vcr in our hotel room .
.
.
we would never even have to go outside !
if we do that , we got to get die hard .
oh ho !
i bet the british version is gooooood !
okay , so we went to the beach , because phoebe found out about this lady who knew her mom and dad , and i don t really know what happened with that .
ehh ?
oh , and then monica joked that she wouldn t go out with a guy like chandler .
.
.
hi there .
.
and he couldn t let it go , and .
.
.
i don t really know what happened with that either .
oh oh !
and then ross s new girlfriend , bonnie , shows up and rachel convinced her to save her head .
and then ross and rachel kiss , and now ross has to choose between rachel and the bald girl and i don t know what happened there either .
.
.
y'know what , hold on , let me go get chandler .

i mean she goes on for five pages about , about how i was unfaithful to her !
we were on a break !
!
!
!
!
oh my god !
if you say that one more time , i m going to break up with you !
fine !

but this break up was not all my fault , and she , she says here ,   if you accept full responsibility .

.
i can begin to trust you again .
does that seem like something you can do .
does it ?
!
!
no ?
look , ross , you have what you want , you re back with rachel .
if you bring this up now you re going to wreck the best thing that even happened to you .
yeah , i know .
i mean , no , you re right .
yeah i guess i ll let it go .
but you you understand how how hard it is to forget about this .
sure , it s hard to forget !
but that doesn t mean you have to talk about it !
a lot of things happened on that trip that we should never ,  ever talk about .
what the hell happened on that beach ?
!
it s between us and the sea , ross !
hi , ursula .
okay , well umm , i know that we haven t talked in a long time , but umm okay , our mom is not our birth mom .

we took a walk , nothing happened .
i can back with nothing all over me .

joey ?
all right .

joey , we swore we d never tell !
they ll never understand !
well , we have to say something !

it s eating me alive !
!
monica got stung by a jellyfish .
all right !
!
all right .
i got stung .
stung bad .
i couldn t stand .
i i couldn t walk .
we were two miles from the house .
scared and alone .
we didn t think we could make it .
i was in too much pain .
and i was tired from digging the huge hole !
and then joey remembered something .
i d seen this thing on the discovery channel .
.
.
wait a minute !
i saw that !
on the discovery channel , yeah !
about jellyfish and how if you .
.
.
ewwww !
!
you peed on yourself ?
!
you can t say that !
!
you you don t know !
!
i mean i thought i was going to pass out from the pain !
anyway i i tried , but i i couldn t .
bend that way .
so .
.
.
that s right i stepped up !
she s my friend and she needed help !
and if i had too , i d pee on anyone of you !
only , uhh , i couldn t .
i got the stage fright .
i wanted to help , but there was too much pressure .
so so i uh , i turned to chandler .
joey kept screaming at me ,  do it now !
do it !
!
do it !
do it now !
!
sometimes late at night i can still here the screaming .
that s  because sometimes i just do it through my wall to freak you out .
.
fuchsia and mauvvve .
those are the 66 colours of my bedroommmm .
thank you , thank you .
ohh , and i invite you to count the colours in your bedroom .
except for you .
you go away .
okay , bye .
no .
but , it s not like we re losing anything .
y'know ?
it s not like we we know each other or anything .
or that have anything in common .
i i like pizza !
oh my god , so do i !
wait wait wait , wait !
puppies .
cute or ugly ?
uh huh , well !
but umm , still i m i m mad at you .

i m kind of hungry .
all right , stop it .
now you re just doing it to freak me out .
oh hooo , i missed you .
i missed you too .
ooh , i was soo nervous about that letter .
but the way you owned up to everything , it just showed me how much you ve grown .
y'know ?
i suppose .
you have !
ross , you should give yourself credit .
i mean my mom never thought this would work out .
it was all ,  once a cheater , always a cheater .
umm hmm .
ooh , i just wish we hadn t lost those four months , but if time was what you needed just to gain a little perspective .
.
.
we were on a break !
!
!
!
!
!
!
coffee house ?
you bet .
and for the record , it took two people to break up this relationship !
!
yeah !
you and that girl from that copy place , which yesterday you took full responsibility for !
!
i didn t know what i was taking full responsibility for !
okay ?
!
i didn t finish the whole letter !
what ?
!
!
i fell asleep !
you fell asleep ?
!
it was 5:30 in the morning , and you had rambled on for 18 pages .
front and back !
!
oh oh oh , and by the way , y of you apostrophe r e means  you are ,  y of you r means  your !
y'know i can t believe i even thought about getting back together again !
we are so over !
!
fine by me !
!
oh , oh , and hey hey hey , those little spelling tips will come in handy when you re at home on saturday nights playing scrabble with monica !
!
hey !
!
sorry !
!
i just feel bad about all that sleep you re going to miss wishing you were with me !
oh , no no no don t you worry about me falling asleep .
i still have your letter !
!
!
and hey !
just so you know , it s not that common !
it doesn t happen to every guy !
and it is a big deal !
!
i knew it !
!
!
!
gin .
we were playing gin ?
y'know if we were a couple , we could play this game naked .
will you stop !
okay .
all right .
okay , all right , i think you re great , i think you re sweet , and you re smart , and i love you .
but you will always be the guy who peed on me .
i just walked in the bathroom and saw kathy naked !
it was like torture !
y'know if we ever go to war and you re captured , you re in for a big surprise .
it just keeps getting worse and worse !
y'know ?
i mean it s bad enough that i m in love with my roommates girlfriend which by the way , i think she knows .
because every time we re in the room together there s this weird like energy between us .
and call me crazy , but i think she likes me too .
and now i have seen her naked .
i mean at least when i ve seen her with clothes on , i could imagine her body was like covered in boles or something .
but there are no boles , she s smooth !
smooth !
wow !
could everyone totally see up his robe ?
great !
all right , so i ll call you later .
hey hey hey !
who was that ?
that would be casey .
we re going out tonight .
goin  out , huh ?
wow !
wow !
so things didn t work out with kathy , huh ?
bummer .
no , things are fine with kathy .
i m having a late dinner with her tonight , right after my early dinner with casey .
what ?
yeah yeah .
and the craziest thing is that i just ate a whole pizza by myself !
wait !
you re going out with kathy !
yeah .
why are you getting so upset ?
well , i m upset for you .
i mean , having sex with an endless line of beautiful women must be very unfulfilling for you .
what is the big deal ?
it s not like we re exclusive .
look , joey , kathy is clearly not fulfilling your emotional needs .
but casey , i mean granted i only saw the back of her head , but i got this sense that she s she s smart , and funny , and gets you .
you got all that from the back of her head ?
all right look , i think it s time for you to settle down .
y'know ?
make a choice , pick a lane .
who s elaine ?
little , tiny tarzan , swinging on a nose hair .
swinging with the greatest of ease   darn it !
now , i don t know who to get to the next verse .
oh , you could just go uh , greatest of ease   bah bah bha bhannn .
then go right into it .
yeah , ooh , i like that !
yeah .
wait !
how do you know about  bah bah bha bhan ?
well umm , y know , i used to play .
oh yeah , that s right , the keyboards , huh ?
yeah , just a little in high school , but then i really got into it in college .
i mean that s that s when i really found my sound .
oh god !
orange juice just came out of my nose , but it was totally worth it .
oh my god , i completely forgot about your sound .
yeah .
he used to lock himself in the basement for hours .
no one was every allowed to hear , the sound .
i want to hear the sound .

i  see but , pheebs that that is the exact opposite intent of my music .
y know my music is is meant to inspire , and if it bothers you this much , then i  i won t play anymore .

what ?
are you serious ?
does joey know ?
no .
is there anyway , anyway you think he ll understand this ?
you obviously haven t screwed over a lot of your friends .
which we all appreciate .
no the the sad thing is , if you had told him how you felt before you kissed her , knowing joey , he probably just would ve just stepped aside .
oh , don t say that !
don t say that .
that s not true .
is it ?
i think maybe , yeah .
he loves you .
then why didn t you tell me to do that ?
!

so you like her huh ?
yes , but i i uh , don t have too .
no no no , no it s uh , it s okay .
yeah ?
yeah .
you know why ?
because you came to me first .
well , i thought that would be the best thing to do .
but hey , listen just so you know , you might have you re work cut out for you .
because when i talked to her , i kind of got the feeling that she s into some other guy .
so  see uh , that s that s actually what i wanted to talk to you about .
i i think i know who the other guy is .
who ?
it s me .
i m the other guy .
what ?
yeah , i mean when you were late last night , kathy and i got to talking , and one thing to another and  and what ?
!
did you sleep with her ?
!
no !
no !
no !
i just kissed her .
what ?
!
!
that s even worse !
!
how is that worse ?
!
i don t know !
but it s the same !
look , i m sorry !
but there s nothing i can do , i think i m in love with her !
who cares ?
!
you went behind my back !
i would never do that to you !
you re right , i have no excuses !
i was totally over the line .
over the line ?
!
you you re you re so far past the line , that you you can t even see the line !
the line is a dot to you !
yes .
yes !
right !
and i feel horrible .
you have to believe me !
is that why you bought all this stuff ?
!
well , y know what i will not watch your tv , i will not listen to your stereo , and there s a cinnamon raisin loaf in the new bread maker that i m not going to eat !
you know why ?
!
probably because  because it s all tainted with your betrayal .
from now on this apartment is empty for me !
and i m not happy about you either .
oh , and just so you know , i made that bread for you .
oh my god , he s lost it .
he s totally lost it .
what ?
phoebe , his music could not get any worse .
there are rats in the basement that are hanging themselves .
thank you , thanks .
yeah , i lost it .
y know , i m not going to play anymore ,  would you , can you finish my set ?
after that ?
yeah !
no , i mean if i can help .
yeah , like i could lose it .
what ?
i played bad on purpose guys .
okay , so you were trying to play bad this whole time .
yeah no , just that last song .
hello .
hey , it s me .
i know you can t stand to be in the same room as me , so i just thought i d try and apologize over the phone .
all i    hello .
look i never should have kissed your girlfriend , but i m    stop callin  !
!
all right !
aww , turkey !
aww , giving thanks !
aww !
look everyone , it s the spirit of thanksgiving !
so are things with you and joey any better ?
they couldn t be worse .
i spent eight hours calling him last night , just trying to get him to talk to me .
oh wow , eight hours ?
so you could probably really use one of those plug in telephone headsets huh ?
should we all expect christmas gifts that can be stolen from your office ?
you shouldn t .
speaking of christmas , umm since monica and i are starting a new business and have like no money , umm , this year maybe we could do secret santa , and then we each only buy one gift .
and and there s the added mystery of who gets who .
who gets whom .
i don t know why i do that .
well , i m going to take a nap , turkey makes me sleepy .
we haven t eaten yet !
i know , but all that work you re doing to get it ready , i just   hey , by any chance did either of pick uh rachel for your secret santa ,  because i want to trade for her .
i picked her !
oh thank god you want her !
ooh !
wow !
why do you want to get rid of her so badly ?
because she exchanges every gift she ever gets , it s like impossible to get her something she likes .
come on , let s trade !
oh that s not true !
that s not true !
i got her that backpack and she loved it !
i remember how much she was crying the day when that big dog ran off with it   oh , there was no big dog .
all right this sucks !
i already got her this briefcase , and i had r.g .
put on it   her initials  ohh .
well , maybe you could give to somebody else .
ooh , like ross geller .
op , y'know what though , it s kind ve a girlie briefcase .
who cares ?
he works in a museum !
hey , what time is it ?
the big game is about to start !
you don t have to do that , ross and joey aren t here , you can watch the parade if you want .
thanks .
what is wrong with this freezer ?
!
ow !
ow !
!
god , what happened ?
!
oh my god , ice just got in my eye !
people are trying to sleep in here !
monica got ice in her eye , and it hurts .
open it up , let me see .
oh , y know what , i can t , it really kills .
well maybe you should put some ice on it .
ooh , god it looks bad .
honey , maybe we should take you to a doctor .
no , my eye doctor is richard !
i can t go to him when i don t have a boyfriend !
he s really picky about his patients .
honey , you ve got to go .
what s his office number ?
like i remember his office number !
speed dial 7 .
hi !
yeah , i m calling on behalf of monica geller s eye , and is um , is richard burke in today .
he s out of town , but does she want to see the on call doctor ?
yes !
!
yes !
she s very excited about that .
this is so cool ,  til monica gets back , it s like i m head chef and i get to make all the decisions .
hey hey , i thought she told you to follow the recipe exactly !
okay , get out of my kitchen !
all right !
okay !
i think i am making some progress with joey , when i went into the apartment he went straight into his bedroom but he only slammed the door once !
i mean yeah , he gave me the finger while doing it .
all right i  i got to call my mom and ask her a left handed cooking question .
so listen ah , i picked monica for secret santa , but i m already getting her something for chanukah , i was wondering if you want to switch .
oh y know what , i was already trying to trade for ah , well , you .
really ?
!
wow !
that s that s so nice , what are you going to get me ?
i don t know r.g .
, i was thinking something girlie for your office .
yeah , well maybe phoebe will switch with me .
oh no no no , you don t want to do that , then you re going to get stuck with rachel and she exchanges every gift she ever gets .
oh , that s not true !
i ve got her lots of stuff she never took back .
like ?
like uh , that gold necklace i got her last year .
when was the last time you saw her wear it ?
well , she wore it all christmas day , and then uh  big dog ?
hey !
hey !
what are you doing ?
i m sending back all this stuff that chandler bought out of guilt .
everything ?
even the tv ?
no !
i m putting that in my room .
listen , joey , i know what he did was wrong but don t you think you could at least hear the guy out ?
back when you and rachel were together , if chandler had kissed her , would you hear him out ?
that s a good point .
so uh , how long are you going to punish him ?
five years .
you ve sentenced him ?
!
hey !
don t do the crime if you can t do the time .
joey , the guy s your best friend .
no , was my best friend .
anyway , i don t know why you re pushing for him so hard .
with him out of the way as my best friend , there s a spot open .
oh , who ?
me ?
yeah !
wow !
i m honored !
and y know what i m going to do as my first act as your best friend ?
what ?
i m going to get you to talk to chandler .
all right .
but if you weren t my best friend .
i walk into a room and he won t even talk to me , he just mumbles something in italian .
and i know he only knows the bad words .
hey gunther , have you uh , have you seen chandler ?
hey joe .
oh my god !
how cute is the on call doctor ?
ooh , so cute , that i m thinking about jamming this pen in my eye .
oh no no no , not dr .
burke .
dr .
burke is out of town .
the the on call doctor will see me now .
hey !
i m sorry !
that  where are you going ?
my folks .
oh , uh , when when are you coming back ?
i don t know .
i might stay there for a few days while i look for an apartment .
what ?
!
yeah , y know at first i thought we could talk about this y know , work it out , but uh , seeing you two together i don t think i  hey , look , what do you want me to say ?
do you want me to say that i ll stop seeing her ?
look , it s not about her .
okay ?
but seeing you two together just reminds me of what you did .
and i don t want to live with some one who doesn t know what it is to be a friend .
so , i ll see ya .
hey , look , i know what it is to be a friend , i just i just screwed up !
yeah !
you did !
and that s why i m leaving .
all right look , if you re not going to stay for me , then at least stay for them !
okay , they have had a very difficult year !
what with the robbery and all !
when that guy was robbing us , and i was locked in the entertainment unit for like six hours , you know what i was doing in there all that time ?
i was thinking about how i let you down !
what ?
yeah !
but if would ve know what kind of friend you were going to turn out to be , i wouldn t have worried about it so much !
see you around !
all right , wait !
come on !
just wait one second !
there has to be something that i can do !
something !
if we still had that entertainment unit i would get in it for six hours and think about how i let you down .
what ?
we ve got a box .
i was probably waiting for it to open .
you look great too .
so how does it look ?
like a pirate ?
!
umm , so how long have you been working with your dad ?
come on , one of us had to mention him .
oh .
big family dinner tonight ?
no way !
oh .
oh .
oh .
so you made her walk the plank ?
aye , matie ?
i know .
he s coming here for thanksgiving !
i know , it s sick .
why is it sick ?
because it s richard s son !
it s like inviting greek tragedy over for dinner !
hey , come on , phoebe , you understand don t you ?
yeah , i can see where i d be your best shot but , no .
i m sorry , but i think it s twisted .
yeah .
what s twisted ?
me going out with richard s son .
ewwwww !
!
ew !
ew !
ew !
sounds like a really bad idea to me .
is he okay in there ?
he s fine !
hey , y'know , mon , if things wrong out between you and richard s son , you d be able to tell your kids , that you slept with their grandfather .
fine !
judge all you want to but ,  married a lesbian ,  left a man at the altar ,  fell in love with a gay ice dancer ,  threw a girl s wooden leg in a fire ,  livin  in a box !
!
so now , what exactly is the point of the box ?
chandler ?
the meaning of the box is three fold .
one  , it gives me the time to think about what i did .
two  , it proves how much i care about my friendship with joey .
and three  , it hurts !
oh hey !
hey uh , you remember the necklace i gave you last year ?
can i see it ?
why ?
i just want to check something .
okay .
now , we ll see .
air hole !
air hole !
!
here it is !
i love it .
i wear it all the time .
the necklace i got you was gold , this one is silver .
huh , well maybe it uh , it changed .
oh my god !
you actually exchanged it !
well isn t it better that i exchanged it for something that i enjoy and that i can get a lot of use out of ?
what did you get ?
credit .
i ll get it !
i ll get it !
i ll get it !
i ll get it !
i ll get it !
i ll get it !
i ll get it !
i ll get it !

fancy soap ?
i thought we were savin  that for the pope !

i saved you a seat .
sick sick sick sick .
oh , i ll get it .
gotcha !
that doesn t sound like thinking to me !
sorry !
y know i don t think you should be talking at all in there !
i think you ve got to much thinking to do to be talking and making jokes !
okay , okay , you got it !
ross , can you pass me the yams ?
sure !
oh , and joey s got the mashed potatoes if you want to exchange them .
would you stop ?
!
what is the matter with you ?
!
oh ho ho , we ve got company .
there s nothing the matter with me .
see , i m not completely devoid of sentiment , see i have feelings .
okay , fine .
you can t tell , but i m trying to break the tension by mooning you guys !
all right , look !
if this is just a big joke to you , then forget about it , all right ?
!
this means something to me !
and if it doesn t mean anything to you , then you should get out of there , otherwise you re just an idiot in a box !
you re right , and i m sorry !
this means a lot to me !
i want you to be my friend again !
i swear , i won t say another word tonight .
so are you going to start taking this thing seriously ?
absolutely !
that sounds like another word to me !
are you going to take this seriously ?
okay .
don t say that i have no sentiment !
this is a movie stub from our first date !
this is an eggshell from the first time you made me breakfast in bed !
this is from the museum from the first time we  were together .
okay , maybe i exchange gifts sometimes , but i keep the things that matter !
i don t know what to say , i m sorry .
though , you re not supposed to take these .
it s like a million years old , we , we actually , we had people looking for that .
ooh , this always happens .
thank you .
y know all my friends think this is weird .
i know !
i mean it s like me and your dad , that s a totally separate thing .
we re just two people who find each other very attractive .
right ?
nothing .
nothing .
no no no that was good , it was , that was uh , that was a goood kiss   don t say it !
yeah !
i know !
i ll get it .
hey .
that s okay .
chandler s the one i m mad at .
in the box .
oh , he he can t talk right now .
he s just trying to show joey how much he means to him .
joey , had reasons .

ben , dinner !
thanks aunt pheebs .
hey , you did not microwave that , did you , because it is breast milk , and you are not supposed to do that .
duh , i think i know how to heat breast milk .
ok .
what did you just do ?
i licked my arm , what ?
it is breast milk .
so ?
phoebe , that is juice , squeezed from a person .
what is the big deal ?
what did you just do ?
ok , would people stop drinking the breast milk ?
you will not even taste it ?
no !
not even if you just pretend that it is milk ?
not even if carol's breast had a picture of a missing child on it .
hey , where is everybody ?
they took ben to the park .
where have you been ?
just out .
had some lunch , just me , little quality time with me .
thanks for your jacket .
oh , no problem .
you can borrow it , by the way .
here are your keys , hon .
okay .
mon , if uh you were at lunch alone , how come it cost you uh 53 dollars ?
you know what probably happened ?
someone musta stolen my credit card .
and sorta just put the receipt back in your pocket ?
that is an excellent excellent question .
that is excellent .
monica , what is with you ?
who would you have lunch with ?
judy .
who ?
julie .
what ?
!
jody !
you were with julie ?
look , when it started i was just trying to be nice to her because she was my brother's girlfriend .
and then , one thing led to another and , before i knew it , we were .
shopping .
oh .
oh my god .
honey , wait .
we only did it once .
it did not mean anything to me .
yeah , right .
sure !
really , rachel , i was thinking of you the whole time .
look , I am sorry , all right .
i never meant for you to find out !
oh , please , you wanted to get caught .
that is not true !
oh , so you just sort of happened to leave it in here ?
did it ever occur to you that i might just be that stupid ?
ok , monica .
i just have to know one thing .
did you go with her to bloomingdale's ?
oh !
ok , ok , ok , i just really , uh , i just really need to not be with you right now .
hi , who is this ?
hi , joanne .
is rachel working ?
it is monica .
yes , i know i did a horrible thing .
joanne , it is not as simple as all that , ok ?
no , i do not care what steve thinks .
hi , steve .
oh , i tasted ben's milk , and ross freaked out .
i did not freak out .
because it is breast milk .
it is gross .
no , no , carol .
there is nothing wrong with it .
i just , i just do not think breast milk is for adults .
of course the packaging does appeal to grown ups and kids alike .
that would be no .
come on .
it does not taste bad .
yeah , it is kind of sweet , sorta like , uh .
.
.
exactly .
you have tasted it ?
you have tasted it .
oh , you have tasted it .
give me the bottle .
give me the towel .
how do you .
give me a box a juice .
well , they switched me over to hombre .
well , maybe it is because of the way you are dressed .
or maybe it is because this guy's doing so good they want to put more people on it .
you should see this guy , chandler , he goes through two bottles a day .
what do you care ?
you are an actor .
this is your day job .
this is not supposed to mean anything to you .
i know , but , i was the best , you know ?
i liked being the best .
i do not know .
maybe i should just get outta the game .
they need guys up in housewares to serve cheese .
all right , say you do that .
you know sooner or later somebody is going to come along that slices a better cheddar .
and then where are you going to run ?
yeah i guess you are right .
you are damn right I am right .
i say you show this guy what you are made of .
i say you stand your ground .
i say you show him that you are the baddest hombre west of the lingerie .
I am going to do it .
all right .
now go see miss kitty and she will fix you up with a nice hooker .
i do not know what else to say .
well that works out good , because I am not listening .
i feel terrible , i really do .
oh , I am sorry , did my back hurt your knife ?
rachel ,  say that I am friends with her , we spend some time together .
is that so terrible ?
yes .
it is that terrible ?
yes .
monica , you do not get it .
it is bad enough that she is stolen the guy who might actually be the person that i am supposed to be with , but now , she is actually  , but now she is actually stealing you .
me ?
what are you talking about ?
nobody could steal me from you .
i mean , just because I am friends with her does not make me any less friends with you .
i mean ,  you are my .
we are , we are .
oh , i love you .
i love you too .
you guys , um i know that this really does not have anything to do with me , but um i love you guys too .
oh , i really needed that .
look , i know that you are in a place right now where you really need to hate julie's guts , but she did not do anything wrong .
i mean , she was just a girl who met a guy , and now they go out .
i really think that if you gave her a chance , you would like her .
would you just give that a chance , for me ?
I would do anything for you , you know that .
I would do anything for you .
wait , wait , wait , wait !
mornin ' .
i said , mornin ' .
yeah , I am ready .
these new kids , they never last .
sooner or later , they all .
stop lastin ' .
listen , uh , what do you say i buy you that cup of coffee now ?
so .
i just thought the two of us should hang out for a bit .
i mean , you know , we have never really talked .
i guess you would know that , being one of the two of us , though , right ?
really ?
me ?
well , you are not totally paranoid .
um , ok , uh , oh god , um , when you and uh ross first started going out , it was really hard for me , um , for many reasons , which I am not going to bore you with now , but um , i just , i see how happy he is , you know , and how good you guys are together , and um , monica's always saying how nice you are , and god i hate it when she is right .
yeah , that would be great .
I would love it .
all right , julie .
bye .
what a manipulative bitch .
that is not bad .
so i told carl ,  nobody , no matter how famous their parents are , nobody is allowed to climb on the dinosaur .
but of course this went in one ear and out .
.

good evening .
i m mr .
tribbiani .
and i will be teaching acting for soap operas .
now um , on my first day as  dr .
drake remoray on days of our lives ,  i learned that one of the most important things in soap opera acting is reacting , this does not mean acting again , it means , you don t have a line , but someone else just did .
and it goes like this .
thanks , thanks , a lot .
oh , by the way , before i forget to work in soap operas some of you will have to become much more attractive .
all right , moving right along .
hi !
hey !

it was a joke , i made a joke .
yeah , actually daddy ross is allergic to lobster .
it s not a library .
.

green , how s the old boat .
it gives it a nice antiquey look .
wow .
i m sorry , when i was a kid i lost a bike to that .
okay .
okay !
aw honey stop !
it s not that bad .
yeah .
op !
uh oh !
i think your dad must ve added wrong .
he only tipped like four percent .
yeah .
that s daddy .
that s daddy ?
!
but doesn t it bother you ?
you re a waitress .
yes , it bothers me ross , but y'know if he was a regular at the coffee house , i d be serving him sneezers .
so ?
so .
ross , i ve bugged him about this a million times , he s not going to change .
you really serve people sneezers ?
well um , i don t .
thanks again , dr .
green .
oh , ah , you don t need that .
the carbon , it s messy , i mean it gets on your fingers and causes , the , the ah , night blindness .
oh , yeah , that would be me , um , i have , i have a problem i i tip way too much , way , way , too much , it s a sickness really .
yeah it is , it is .
we really , really have to do something about that .
i know .
oh daddy , no he didn t mean anything by that , he really didn t .
nothing i do means anything , really .
well mr .
big shot is better than  wethead  .
okay , some tricks of the trade .
now , i ve never been able to cry as an actor , so if i m in a scene where i have to cry , i cut a hole in my pocket , take a pair of tweezers , and just start pulling .
or ah , or , let s say i want to convey that i ve just done something evil .
that would be the basic  i have a fishhook in my eyebrow and i like it   okay , let s say i ve just gotten bad news , well all i do there is try and divide 232 by 13 .
and that s how it s done .
great soap opera acting tonight everybody , class dismissed .
hey hey .
awww , one of my students got an audition .
i m so proud .
you bet !
what s the part ?
you had to do it , didn t you ?
you couldn t just leave it alone .
four percent .
okay .
i tip more than that when there s a bug in my food .
ross , tonight was about the two of you getting along .
oh , would you just see my chiropractor , already .
yeah , i m going to go to a doctor who went to school in a mini mall .
hey pheebs , what are you doing ?
i m , i m freaking out !
monica kind of trusted me with something and she shouldn t have !
all right , i haven t lived here in a while , so i have to ask you something .
does monica still turn on the lights in her bedroom ?
um .
yeah .
i am soo dead .
all right , look , here s the bottom line ross , this is fixable , if we act fast , okay .
so , i ll invite him to brunch tomorrow and you can make nice .
look , honey , i have tried to make nice , it doesn t work .
okay , look , ross , i realise that my father is difficult , but that s why you have got to be the bigger man here .
look sweetie , i could be the bigger man , i could be the biggest man , i could be a big , huge , giant man , and it still wouldn t make any difference , except that i could pick your father up and say  like me !
like me tiny doctor !
okay , well can t you just try it one more time ross ?
for me ?
for me ?
rachel one brunch is not going to solve anything .
you got to face it , okay we re never going to get along .
okay , well you are just going to have too , okay .
because i already got a mother and a father who cannot stay in the same room together , okay , i don t want to have to have a separate room for you too !

there will come a time in each of your careers when you ll have a chance to screw over another soap opera actor .
i had such an opportunity in the recent , present .
and i m ashamed to say that i took it , i advised a fellow actor to play a role , homosexually .
yeah , we both auditioned for the part , and uh , as it turned out , they ah , they liked the stupid gay thing and cast him .
and now , he s got a two year contract opposite susan luchhi , the first lady of daytime television , and me , me i m stuck here teaching a bunch of people , most of whom are too ugly to even be on tv .
i m sorry , i m sorry , i m sorry .

uh huh , that one !
y'know what , just give me a second and I will be out of your hair .
I am just going to grab a jacket .
when i get back , i want every little detail .
maybe that is him .
okay , umm , okay , umm   it is just joey and ross .
why are not you guys at the movie ?
well , we were !
but ross was talking so loud on his phone they threw us out !
i had to talk loud because the movie was loud !
he is talking to london !
but why ?
!
did he get in touch with emily ?
well no , not yet .
he is calling everyone on her side of the family hoping that someone will help him get in touch with her .
i i i do not care if i said some other girl's name you prissy , old twit !
ross !
way to suck up to the family .
ha ha ha   enh enh .
I am so glad you guys are all here !
my office finally got wrinkle free fax paper !
hey !
oh no no no no no no , vomit tux !
no no , vomit tux !
do not worry , i had it dry cleaned .
vomit tux ?
who vomited on y'know what , what you up to joe ?
well , I am doing this telethon thing on tv and my agent got me a job as co host !
oh that is great !
a little uh , good deed for pbs and a little tv exposure , now that is the kind of math joey likes to do !
ugh , pbs !
what is wrong with pbs ?
ugh , what is right with them ?
why don t you like pbs , pheebs ?
okay , because right after my mom killed herself , i was just in this really bad place , y'know personally .
so , i just thought that it would make me feel better if i wrote to sesame street , because they were so nice when i was a little kid !
no one ever wrote back .
well y'know a lot of those muppets do not have thumbs .
all i got was a lousy key chain !
and by that time i was living in a box .
i did not have keys !
I am sorry pheebs , i just , y'know , i just wanted to do a good deed .
like like you did with the babies .
this is not a good deed , you just wanted to get on tv !
this is totally selfish .
whoa !
whoa !
whoa !
what about you , having those babies for your brother ?
talk about selfish !
what what are you talking about ?
!
well , yeah , it was a really nice thing and all , but it made you feel really good right ?
yeah .
so ?
it made you feel good , so that makes it selfish .
look , there is no unselfish good deeds , sorry .
yes there are !
there are totally good deeds that are selfless .
well , may i ask for one example ?
yeah , it is  y'know there is no you may not !
that is because all people are selfish .
are you calling me selfish ?
!
are you calling you people ?
yeah , well sorry to burst that bubble , pheebs , but selfless good deeds do not exist .
okay ?
and you the deal on santa clause right ?
I am going to find a selfless good dead .
I am going to beat you , you evil genius .
hello .
emily ?
emily !
oh my god !
oh my god , it is emily !
it is emily everyone !
shush shush shhst !
hi !
no wait !
look , wait !
okay , you can hang up , but I am going to keep calling !
I am going to , I am going to call everyone in england if that is what it takes to get you to talk to me !
look you are my wife .
we are we are married .
y'know ?
i i love you .
i i really miss you .
she is talking .
hey , joey , when you said the deal with santa clause , you meant ?
that he does not exist .
right .
so chandler , have you heard about monica's secret boyfriend ?
uhh , yeah .
she uh , she uh , she uh might have mentioned him .
so mon , when are we going to meet this new secret waiter man ?
ohh , he is really shy .
i i don t think he is up to meeting everyone yet .
yeah , i do not think he is up to meeting everyone yet .
i don t care !
i want to meet this guy who is the best sex she ever had !
really ?
!
that is what you heard ?
you said that ?
i might have said that .
why is that funny ?
because I am very happy for him !
and you , you lucky dog !
hi !
hey !
well , emily's willing to work on the relationship .
yes !
that is great !
in london !
what ?
!
she wants me to move to london .
but you live here !
you know that .
what what what are you going to do ?
i bet if i talk to carol and susan i can convince them to move to london with ben .
yeah , I am sure your ex wife will be more than happy to move to another country so you can patch things up with your new wife .
it could happen .
how ya doin ' ?
welcome .
good to see ya !
that is great .
but uh , I am not really expecting a lot of calls .
but I am the host !
you do not seem to understand .
see , i was dr .
drake remoray .
i cannot believe i can not find a selfless good deed !
y'know that old guy that lives next to me ?
well , i snuck over there and and raked up all the leaves on his front stoop .
but he caught me and force fed me cider and cookies .
then i felt wonderful .
that old jackass !
maybe joey's right .
maybe all good deeds are selfish .
i will find a selfless good deed !
because i just gave birth to three children and i will not let them be raised in a world where joey is right !
hey , monica ?
can i ask you a cooking question ?
sure !
if you are cooking on the stove , does that mean that your new secret boyfriend is better in bed than richard ?
chandler !
is he ?
well , y'know i i i think I am going to respect the privacy of my new secret boyfriend .
why ?
!
i mean if this guy was me and it was me who had learned that it was me who was the best you would ever had , I would be going like this .
all right emily , as much as i love you , I am sorry , i can not move to london without ben .
yeah , would you please consider moving here ?
i mean you were going to move here anyway , why can not you just do that ?
oh oh okay , but but i know , that even though I have been a a complete idiot up 'til now , i mean , i mean you you you have to come here .
you have to come here so we can work this out .
all right , did you just say all right ?
oh , emily that is , that is so great .
it is going to be so great !
we are going to be like like like two idiots in love !
yes , tell me .
i know .
i am , i am so sorry .
again , very sorry .
emily , there is nothing between rachel and me .
okay ?
i love you .
oh that is so great !
that is  so i asked emily if she would come to new york , and she said yes .
yes !
ooh ohh !
great !
no no no !
only if i promise never to see rachel again .
why ?
what ?
!
you can not what did you tell her ?
i told her I would have to think about it .
i mean , how the hell am i supposed to make this kind of a decision ?
I am actually asking you !
well , you can not just not see rachel anymore , she is one of your best friends .
yeah !
but , he can not not exactly see emily , i mean that is his wife .
yeah .
that is true !
yeah , but you have known rachel since high school and you cannot just cut her out of your life .
that is true !
no , you cannot .
thanks for the help , problem solved .
hello .
hey mon !
oh hey joey !
we have been watching all day , when are you going to be on tv ?
see , there was kind of a mix up in my agent's office , but I am still on tv and that is good exposure .
you are not on tv .
oh , uh , okay , how , how about now ?
hey , there he is !
there he is !
hello new york !
how many times have i told you guys , you never watch the cooking channel !
hi chandler .
hey !
uh , listen , i need that broiling pan that joey borrowed the other day .
oh that was yours ?
uh , yeah , we used it when the duck was throwing up caterpillars .
william sonoma , fall catalog , page 27 .
expect it in 4 6 weeks .
umm , hey , umm , joey's going to be at the telethon for the rest of the day , we have the whole place to ourselves .
yeah , so ?
well i just , thought maybe you would want to book some time with the best you would ever had .
y'know what , champ ?
i think I will pass .
why ?
why ?
what is your point ?
pbs telethon .
hey joey , i just wanted to let you know that i found a selfless good deed .
i just went down to the park and i let a bee sting me .
what ?
!
what good is that going to do anybody ?
well , it helps the bee look tough in front of his bee friends .
the bee is happy and i am definitely not .
now , y'know the bee probably died after he stung ya .
aw , dammit !
hey , excuse me , would you mind switching with me ?
come on man !
you have been here all day !
okay , that is it .
i cannot make this decision !
it is too difficult , so I am just going to leave it entirely to the gods of fate .
a magic eight ball ?
!
you can not be serious , you can not make this decision with a toy !
ooh , it is not a toy .
well , i do not know what else to do .
i mean , i either keep my wife and lose one of my my my best friends or i keep my friend and get divorced the second time before I am 30 !
so so if anyone has has a better suggestion , let us hear it !
because i i got nothing !
all right , do not be shy , any suggestion will do .
okay then .
here we go .
magic 8 ball , should i never see rachel again ?
ask again later .
later is not good enough .
ask again later .
what the hell !
this is broken !
it it is broken !
all right , let me see .
will chandler have sex tonight ?
do not count on it .
seems like it works to me .
pbs telethon .
hi joey .
hey pheebs !
i would like to make a pledge .
i would like to donate $200 .
$200 ?
are you sure pheebs ?
i mean , after what sesame street did to ya ?
oh , I am still mad at them but i also now that they bring happiness to lots of kids who is moms did not kill themselves , so by supporting them , I am doing a good thing , but I am not happy about it .
so there , a selfless good deed .
and you do not a little good about donating the money ?
no , it sucks .
i was saving up to buy a hamster .
a hamster ?
what , those things are like 10 bucks .
yeah , not the one i had my eye on .
oh , look look , joey's on tv !
is not that great ?
my pledge got joey on tv !
oh that makes me feel oh no !
look , maybe i got carried away before .
but there is something you got to know .
if I am the best , it is only because you have made me the best .
keep talking .
i mean i was nothing before you .
call the other girls and ask .
which would not take long .
but when I am with you , and we are together , oh my god .
really ?
oh aw my god !
now , i understand if you never want to sleep with me again , but that would be wrong .
we are too good !
we owe it , to sex !
well , if we owe it ?
oh my  when is joey going to be home ?
well , i was kind of hoping we could do this without him .
oh no no no , leave the gloves on .

.
I am very very aware of my tongue .
.
.

c'mon !
here goes .
hi .
.
.

.
.
would you like to go out with me sometime , thankyou , goodnight .

she said yes !
!
she said yes !
!
awful play , man .
whoah .
her name's aurora , and she is italian , and she pronounces my name 'chand lrr ' .
'chand lrr ' .
i think i like it better that way .
oh , listen , the usher gave me this to give to you .
what is it ?
the estelle leonard talent agency .
wow , an agency left me its card !
maybe they want to sign me !
based on this play ?
.
based on this play !
hey , kids .
no , because this line is passion , and this is .
.
.
just a line .
well , i can not believe I have been here almost seven seconds and you have not asked me how my date went .
oh , right , right .
how was your date , 'chand lrr ' ?
it was unbelievable .
i I have never met anyone like her .
she is had the most amazing life !
she was in the israeli army .
.
.
alright .
once i got on the subway , right , and it was at night , and i rode it all the way to brooklyn .
.
.
just for the hell of it .
we talked 'til like two .
it was this perfect evening .
.
.
more or less .
oh , I am sorry , so 'we ' is ?
who is rick ?
who is rick ?
oh , so you are divorced ?
oh , I am sorry , then you are widowed ?
.
hopefully ?
so tell me , how do   how do you think your husband would feel about you sitting here with me ?
.
sliding your foot so far up my pant leg you can count the change in my pocket ?
ethan ?
there is , there is an ethan ?
so explain something to me here , uh , what kind of a relationship do you imagine us having if you already have a husband and a boyfriend ?
.
hm .
oh .
I am sorry it did not work out .
what 'not work out ' ?
I am seeing her again on thursday .
did not you listen to the story ?
did not you listen to the story ?
i mean , this is twisted !
how could you get involved with a woman like this ?
well , y'know , i had some trouble with it at first too , but the way i look at it is , i get all the good stuff : all the fun , all the talking , all the sex ; and none of the responsibility .
i mean , this is every guy's fantasy !
oh , yeah .
that is not true .
ross , is this your fantasy ?
no , of course not !
.
yeah , yeah , it is .
what ?
so you guys do not mind going out with someone else who is going out with someone else ?
i could not do it .
good for you , joey .
when I am with a woman , i need to know that I am going out with more people than she is .
well , y'know , monogamy can be a , uh , tricky concept .
i mean , anthropologically speaking   fine .
fine , alright , now you will never know .
we are kidding .
c'mon , tell us !
alright .
there is a theory , put forth by richard leakey   tah daaah !
are we greeting each other this way now ?
because i like that .
look !
i cleaned !
i did the windows , i did the floors .
.
.
i even used all the attachments on the vacuum , except that little round one with the bristles , i do not know what that is for .
oh yeah , nobody knows .
and we are not supposed to ask .
well , whaddya think ?
.
oh !
i i see you moved the green ottoman .
how how did that happen ?
i dunno .
.
i i thought it looked better there .
and i   and also , it is an extra seat around the coffee table .
yeah , yeah , it is interesting .
.
but y'know what ?
just for fun , let us see what it looked like in the old spot .
alright , just to compare .
let us see .
well , it looks good there too .
let us just leave it there for a while .
i can not believe you tried to move the green ottoman .
thank god you did not try to fan out the magazines .
i mean , she will scratch your eyes right out .
you guys , i am not that bad !
yeah , you are , monica .
remember when i lived with you ?
you were like , a little , y'know ,  ree !
ree !
ree !
ree !
that is so unfair !
oh c'mon !
when we were kids , yours was the only raggedy ann doll that was not raggedy !
okay , so I am responsible , I am organised .
but hey , i can be a kook .
alright , you madcap gal .
try to imagine this .
the phone bill arrives , but you do not pay it right away .
why not ?
because you are a kook !
instead you wait until they send you a notice .
i could do that .
okay , uh , you let me go grocery shopping , and i buy laundry detergent , but it is not the one with the easy pour spout .
why would someone do that ?
!
.
one might wonder .
someone is left a glass on the coffee table .
there is no coaster .
it is a cold drink , it is a hot day .
little beads of condensation are inching their way closer and closer to the surface of the wood .
.
.
stop it !
!
.
oh my god .
it is true !
who am i ?
monica ?
you are mom .
ree !
ree !
ree !
ree !
ree !
uh huh .
.
uh huh .
.
.
oh my god !
okay !
okay , I will be there !
that was my agent .
my agent has just gotten me a job .

well , what is the part ?
can you believe this ?
al pacino !
this guy's the reason i became an actor !
I am out of order ?
pfeeeh .

oh my god .
c'mon , you guys .
this is a real movie , and al pacino's in it , and that is big !
oh no , it is terrific , it is .
.
.
it is .
.
.
y'know , you deserve this , after all your years of struggling , you have finally been able to crack your way into showbusiness .
okay , okay , fine !
make jokes , i do not care !
this is a big break for me !
you are right , you are right , it is .
so you going to invite us all to the big opening ?
alright , alright , alright .
.
.
here .
i need to borrow some moisturizer .

.
.
who is being loud ?
oh , that would be monica .
hey , listen , i want to borrow a coupla things , aurora spent the night , i really want to make her breakfast .
oh , you got the whole night , huh ?
yeah , well , i only have twenty minutes until ethan , so , y'know .
.
ooh , do i sense a little bit of resentment ?
no , no resentment , believe me , it is worth it .
'kay ?
y'know in a relationship you have these key moments that you know you will remember for the rest of your life ?
well , every   single   second is like that with aurora .
.
and I have just wasted about thirty five of them talking to you people , so , uh .
.
monica , can you help me with the door ?
sure .
oh , um , chandler ?
y'know , the the old monica would would remind you to scrub that teflon pan with a plastic brush .
but I am not going to do that .
uh , listen , i just want to thank you for this great opportunity .
me ?
right .
okay .
losing the robe .
and the robe is lost .
well , I am   I am showering .
oh .
well , the way i see it , the guy's upset here , y'know ?
i mean , his wife's dead , his brother's missing .
.
.
i think his butt would be angry here .
i was going for quiet desperation .
but if you have to ask .
.
.
god , i love these fingers .
.
.
no , actually i meant my fingers .
look at  them , look at how happy they are .
oh no nonononononnononono , do not go .
.
do not go .
too bad , she is leaving .
well , i thought   i thought you talked to rick .
what , ethan ?
he got to spend the whole day with you !
i know there will be many moments in the years to come when I will regret asking the following question , but   and andrew is ?
oh , so what you are saying is you are not completely fulfilled by rick , ethan and myself ?
well , y'know , most women would kill for three guys like us .
you .
nono , just you .
lose the other guys .
c'mon , we are great together , why not ?
.
well , y'know , part of me wants that , but it is like I am two guys , y'know ?
i mean , one guy's going 'shut up !
this is great ! '
but there is this other guy .
actually it is the same guy that wells up every time that grinch's heart grows three sizes and breaks that measuring device .
.
.
and he is saying , y'know , 'this is too hard !
get out !
get out ! '
i do not know , i i have to listen to both of them , they do not exactly let each other finish .
.
.
.
the second guy .
sorry , the first guy runs the lips .
look at it this way : you dumped her .
right ?
i mean , this woman was unbelievably sexy , and beautiful , intelligent , unattainable .
.
.
tell me why you did this again ?
hey , waitwait , are not you the guy that plays the butt in the new al pacino movie ?
nope .
no ?
what happened , big guy ?
big guy ?
it felt like a 'big guy ' moment .
i got fired .
yeah , they said i acted too much with it .
i told everybody about this !
now everybody's going to go to the theatre , expecting to see me , and .
.
.
oh , joey , you know what , no one is going to be able to tell .
my mom will .
something so sweet and .
disturbing about that .
y'know , I have done nothing but crappy plays for six years .
and i finally get my shot , and i blow it !
maybe this was not your shot .
yeah , i mean .
.
.
i think when it is your shot , y'know , you you know it is your shot .
did it .
.
.
feel like your shot .
.
?
hard to tell , i was naked .
no , i do not think this was your shot .
i mean , i do not even think you just get one shot .
i really believe big things are going to happen for you , i do !
you have got to just keep thinking about the day that some kid is going to run up to his friends and go 'i got the part !
i got the part !
I am going to be joey tribbiani's ass ! '
.
yeah ?
that is so nice !
I am sorry , joey .
I am going to go to bed , guys .
uh , mon , you you going to leave your shoes out here ?
uh huh !
really ?
just casually strewn about in that reckless haphazard manner ?
does not matter , I will get  them tomorrow .
or not .
whenever .
she is a kook .
if it bothers you that much , just go out and get the shoes .
no .
do not do this .
this is stupid !
i do not have to prove anything , I am going to go get them .
but then everyone will know .
unless i get them , and then wake up really early and put them back !
.
i need help !
guys , guys , I have got great news !
guess what  uh , ah , monica's pregnant ?
!
really ?
let us get past the moment .
what is your news ?
thank you .
i got a job in advertising .
oh , honey , that is incredible !
gosh , what is the pay like ?
oh , come on people   come on , now , if i do not know who makes the most , how do i know who i like the most !
hey joey !
actually , it pays nothing .
it is an internship .
oh , that is cool .
we have interns at 'days of our lives ' .
right .
so , it will be the same except  less sex with you .
so , uh , what kind of stuff do you think they will have you do there ?
well , it is a training program , but at the end , they hire the people they like .
that is great .
yeah , i mean , there is probably going to be some ground work which will probably stink , you know , grown man getting people coffee is a little humiliating  humiliating and noble !
you know , if i did not already have a job , i think , i would have been really good in advertising .
ross , you did not come up with got milk ?
yes , i did , i did !
i should have written it down !
hey !
hey !
where is chandler ?
i want to wish him good luck on his first day .
.
.
.
and i smelled bacon .
he just left .
who did ?
joey !
you never going to believe it : she called .
she did ?
you got it !
i did ?
what is she talking about ?
i do not know , but it sounds great .
your agent called .
you got that audition .
with lennart haze ?
yes .
oh my god , that is great !
that is  * * * for a play on broadway  and in a real theatre , not that little one underneath the dally like last time .
is it a good play ?
well , it must be , because i read and i did not understand a singe word .
yeah , and lennart haze is starring in it  yeah , yeah , and directing .
he was so good in that movie of macbeth .
you saw that ?
no , but  i saw the previews .
they played it right before jackass .
yeah , he is done some amazing works .
oh , yeah .
oh , i loved him in those cell phone commercials .
i know .
when the monkey hits him in the face with that giant rubber phone .
hey !
maybe the monkey will be at the audition !
do not make me more nervous than i already am !
good morning , everybody .
oh , no , no , I am an intern , just like you guys  except for the tie , the briefcase  and the fact that i can rent a car .
yeah , well , I am kind of heading into a new career direction and , you know , you got to start at the bottom .
right .
look , i know I am a little bit older than you guys , but it is not like I am bob hope  the comedian ?
uso ?
!
it is so amazing to meet you .
I am such a big fan of your work .
tell me about it !
unlimited nights and weekends !
no , i i i was not making fun of you , honestly , i i think you were great in those commercials .
yeah .
are you kiddin ' ?
when they shoot you out of that cannon  wow !
oh , yah , sure .
err , i think you know  .
i am what you made me .
you know what ?
i could go right now .
i can not .
oh , i want to , long pause , but i can not .
oh , oh , i thought that was your character's name , you know , i thought you were like an indian or something , you know with a   ah , y y you are sure you do not want me to do it again ?
i could do it with an accent , you know , southern  i could go right now , maaan !
ah , hi , ah .
thank you so much for whispering for my benefit , but , ah , look , if you just tell me what i did wrong , I would just love to work on it and come back and try it again for you .
and , and also :  'how you doing ? '
you should , please , just give me another chance .
i really want to get better , please .
yeah .
i really doubt that .
could not i just sleep with the producer ?
hey , do you want to go to dinner tonight ?
oh , i can not .
I have got a date with that waitress , katy , yeah , i know we have been only going out like twice , but i have a really good feeling about her .
oh , i hear divorce bells .
what ?
of ok .
just relax , phoene , just stay calm .
.
oh my god , i can not find my wallet .
no .
what do you mean no  ?
i knew you would be my death , phoebe buffay .
lowell , is that you ?
oh my god !
I am sorry , ross , this is my old friend lowell from the streets .
lowell , ross .
yeah , a real pleasure .
ah , it is been so long , so long .
i can not believe you are still doing this !
good for you !
ouh    oh my god .
phoebe , you used to mug people ?
excuse me , ross , old friends catching up  hey , how did the audition go ?
well , they want to see me again this afternoon , but , err , well , lennart haze did not like me .
what happened ?
well , he said i was not urgent enough , you know , and that everything i did was horizontal and i should be more vertical .
oh , and he said that i should think less .
so far so good !
honey , I am old !
what is wrong ?
i am so much older than these other interns .
i can not compete with them .
so you are a little older .
try to look at the positive : you have all this life experience .
yes , but i do not think life experience with these .
wooooooooow  it is like they are on fire !
what are they ?
they are these prototype sneakers and come up with ideas on how to sell them which i can not do because no self respecting adult would ever where these .
i give you  $ 500 for them !
what am i supposed to do with these ?
ah , come on , sneakers are easy .
you wear sneakers all the time .
well , first of all , they are not called sneakers  anymore .
apparently , they are called kicks  or skids  and i think i heard somebody say slorps  .
and here , look : they have got these wheels to pop out from the bottom so you can roll around because , apparently , walking is too much exercise .
kids , kids , roll your way to childhood obesity !
would you help me try to sell these ?
okay , have you considered using a girl with huge knockers ?
no , i do not think that is the kind of thing they are looking for .
hey , that would work on me !
why did i get to buy mrs .
butterwords ?
hey , you will never guess what just happened  phoebe and i got mugged !
you okay ?
!
yah , because phoebe knew the mugger !
how do you know a mugger ?
I am sorry i have friends outside the six of us .
you want to know how she knew him ?
because phoebe used to mug people .
seriously ?
well , I am not proud of it , but , you know  sometimes when i was living on the street and i needed money for food and stuff i   phoebe , that is awful !
well , ok , i was not rich like you guys , ok , i did not eat gold and have a flying pony  i had a hard life , my mother was killed by a drug dealer  you are mother killed herself !
she was a drug dealer !
well , anyway , it was a good thing phoebe knew the knew him , because  i was about to do some serious damage !
okay  well , this must have brought back some really bad memories for you , ross .
why ?
well , ross was mugged as a kid .
you were ?
yeah , it was pretty traumatic .
i was outside st .
marc's comics  you know , i i i was just there minding my own business , you know , seeing what kind of trouble spiderman got into that week    wonderwoman !
anyway , i was heading towards this bakery , you know , to pick up a couple of dozen linzer torts for someone     when outta nowhere this thug with a pipe jumps out and says : give me your money , punk !
oh my god  i know !
and and the worst part was they took my backpack which had all the original artwork i had done for my own comic book : science boy  oh yeah !
what was his superpower again ?
a superhuman thirst for knowledge .
that is it .
well , i i better get to class  are there any more of your friends i should look out for on my way , phoebe ?
no  actually , you might want to stay away from jane street  that is where stabby joe works .
okay , i think we have a problem here .
what ?
well , uhm , back in my mugging days , you know , i , uhm , i worked st .
marc's comics .
yeah ?
well , a pipe was my weapon of choice and , uhm , pre teen comic book nerds were my meat .
so ?
well , there was this one kid who had a sticker on his backpack that said   oh my god !
i know  i mugged ross !
i know , I am sorry , but can i just have a quick second to run to the bathroom ?
but I am bursting with you hu !
actually , i really need  yes  ahahaaa   i think you know !
i am what you made me !
you know what ?
i could go right now .
i , oh , i can not .
i want to , but i can not !
i did ?
sure , yeah .
i do not have time to say thank you because i really got to go .
hey !
hey !
what are you doing ?
putting on the sneakers  thought I would get into a younger mindset , you know , to see if it sparked anything  oh , anything yet ?
yes , how is this : they are so uncomfortable it is like getting kicked in the nuts for your feet !
hey !
probably want to know what I am doing  ?
no , that seems about right .
yesterday at my audition , i really had to pee , and apparently , having to pee makes me a really good actor .
i got a call back , so I am drinking everything .
oh , by the way , that egg nog in our fridge was great !
joey , that was formula .
we got to get more of that .
you know what  these are not half bad !
you should suggest something like these to ralph lauren .
okay , first of all , that is stupid and second of all , I am not allowed to talk to ralph .
alright  i feel youger already !
yah , i think i broke my hip .
hey , you !
hey !
hey , how was class ?
no one ever asked me that , what is wrong ?
nothing , i really want to know .
oh   well , uhm , there was actually a rather lively discussion about the pleistocene   alright , nothing is worth this .
uhm , i have a confession to make  uhm , okay , you know , that girl that mugged you when you were a kid   wh what are you talking about ?
it was not a girl .
it was this huge dude .
you do not have to lie anymore , ross , i know that it was a fourteen year old girl .
no , it was not .
yes , it was .
no , it was not .
you do not think i would have defended myself against a fourteen year old   give me your money , punk !
oh my god , it was you !
i can not believe it , you  you mugged me ?
yeah , and I am so , so sorry , ross , I am sorry , but , you know , if you think about it , it is kind of neat .
i mean , well , it is just that i I have always felt kind of like an outsider , you know , the rest of you have these connections that go way back and , you know , now , you and i have  have a great one !
it is not the best !
i know , I am sorry , please forgive me .
i do not know what to say   there is nothing you can say .
that was the most humiliating thing that ever happened to me .
really ?
even more humiliating than   hey , let us not do this !
okay   you start on the image of a guy putting on the shoes .
he is about my age  a huh .
so he is rolling down the street and he starts to lose control , you know  maybe he falls  maybe hurts himself .
just then , a kid comes flying by wearing the shoes .
he jumps over the old guy and laughs , and the line reads : not suitable for adults !
oh , thank you , sir  or man who is two years younger than me   i do not know , i don ' i don ' know !
i was just trying to get into a young mindset , you know , and it just started to flow .
the cold weather hurts my hip !
hey , ross !
i know you are still mad at me , but can i just talk to you for a second ?
sure , go ahead .
whoops , sorry , sure , go ahead .
i just really wanted to apologize again and  and also show you something i think you will find very exciting .
oh my god , crap from the street ?
look , ross , in this box are all the things i got from mugging that i thought were too special to sell  or smoke .
anyway , i was looking through it and i found science boy   oh my god .
i never thought I would see this again .
it is all here .
what made you save it all these years ?
i can not say , i just thought it was really good  and  maybe would be worth something some day .
you really thought science boy  was worth saving !
yeah  but you should know , i also have a jar of vaseline and a cat skull in here .
still  this is amazing  oh my god , thank you , phoebe .
you are welcome .
and thank you for science boy  .
i learned a lot from him you are welcome .
i need an answer !
you know !
i need an answer now !
oh !
you knew this all along and you never told me ?
you never told me ?
i can never forgive you , i can never forgive myself , i have nothing to live for   bang   end scene !
oh thanks , thanks !
now , i really have to get  wow , that is a big cable bill !
huh , you do not have a job , but you have no problem ordering porn  on a saturday afternoon ?
!
i was in the house !
hey , uhm , phoebe did not by any chance mention that    that she was the huge guy that mugged you ?
yah .
i see .
you did not happen to tell    everybody we know ?
yeah .
great .
thanks !
everybody ?
shh , shhh .

jill says vestibule .
.

yes , he was some guy .
hi everyone .
and officiating at tonight's blackout , is rabbi tribbiani .

.

chandler , listen .
yeah , like that thought never entered my mind .
alright , somebody .
ok , I will go .
ok , senior year of college .
.
.
on a pool table .
that is my sister .
ok .
.
.
my weirdest place would have to be .
.
.
the women's room on the second floor of the new york city public library .
oh my god !
what were you doing in a library ?
pheebs , what about you ?
oh .
.
.
milwaukee .
um .
.
.
ross ?
disneyland , 1989 , 'it is a small world after all . '
the ride broke down .
so , carol and i went behind a couple of those mechanical dutch children .
.
.
then they fixed the ride , and we were asked never to return to the magic kingdom .
oh , rachel .
oh come on , i already went .
you did not go !
oh , alright .
the weirdest place would have to be .
.
.
.
.
.
oh , the foot of the bed .
step back .
we have a winner !
i just never had a relationship with that kind of passion , you know , where you have to have somebody right there , in the middle of a theme park .
well , it was the only thing to do there that did not have a line .
there , well , see ?
barry would not even kiss me on a miniature golf course .
come on .
no , he said we were holding up the people behind us .
and you did not marry him because .
.
.
?
i mean , do you think there are people who go through life never having that kind of .
.
.
probably .
but you know , I will tell you something .
passion is way overrated .
yeah right .
it is .
eventually , it kind of .
.
.
burns out .
but hopefully , what you are left with is trust , and security , and .
.
.
well , in the case of my ex wife , lesbianism .
so , you know , for all of those people who miss out on that passion .
.
.
thing , there is all that other good stuff .
ok .
but , um .
.
.
i do not think that is going to be you .
you do not .
uh uh .
see , i see .
.
.
.
big passion in your future .
really ?
mmmm .
you do ?
i do .
oh ross , you are so great .
it is never going to happen .
what ?
you and rachel .
what ?
why not ?
because you waited too long to make your move , and now you are in the friend zone .
no , no , no .
I am not in the zone .
ross , you are mayor of the zone .
I am taking my time , alright ?
I am laying the groundwork .
yeah .
i mean , every day i get just a little bit closer to .
.
.
priesthood !
look ross , I am telling you , she has no idea what you are thinking .
if you do not ask her out soon you are going to end up stuck in the zone forever .
i will , i will .
see , I am waiting for the right moment .
what ?
what , now ?
yeeeeaaaahhh !
what is messing you up ?
the wine ?
the candles ?
the moonlight ?
you have just got to go up to her and say , 'rachel , i think that .
.
. '
shhhh !
what are you shushing ?
we are shushing .
.
.
because .
.
.
we are trying to hear something .
listen .
do not you hear that ?
ahhhh !
see ?
huh .
um , is it sugarless ?
oh , then no thanks .
what the hell was that ?
mental note : if jill goodacre offers you gum , you take it .
if she offers you mangled animal carcass , you take it .
new york city has no power , and the milk is getting sour .
but to me it is not scary , because i stay away from dairy .
.
.
.
la la la , la la , la la .
.
.
ok , here goes .
are you going to do it ?
I am going to do it .
do you want any help ?
you come out there , you are a dead man .
good luck , man .
thanks .
ok .
ok .
hey , where are you going ?
outside .
you can not go out there .
why not ?
because of .
.
.
the reason .
and that would be ?
i , um , can not tell you .
joey , what is going on ?
ok , you have got to promise that you will never , ever tell ross that i told you .
about what ?
he is planning your birthday party .
oh my god !
i love him !
you would better act surprised .
about what ?
my surprise party !
what surprise party ?
oh stop it .
joey already told me .
well , he did not tell me .
hey , do not look at me .
this is ross's thing .
this is so typical .
I am always the last one to know everything .
no , you are not .
we tell you stuff .
yuh huh !
i was the last one to know when chandler got bitten by the peacock at the zoo .
i was the last one to know when you had a crush on joey when he was moving in .
looks like i was second to last .
hmmm .
.
.
this is so nice .
ok , i have a question .
well , actually , it is not so much a question as .
.
more of a general wondering .
.
.
ment .
ok .
ok .
here goes .
for a while now , I have been wanting to , um .
.
.
.
ohhh !
!
!
!
yes , yes , that is right .
.
.
oh , look at the little cat !
what ?
ow !
this is just bactine .
it will not hurt .
sorry , that was wax .
oh , poor little tooty is scared to death .
we should find his owner .
why do not we just put 'poor little tooty ' out in the hall ?
during a blackout ?
he would get trampled !
yeah ?
you know , on second thought , gum would be perfection .
'gum would be perfection ' ?
'gum would be perfection . '
could have said 'gum would be nice , ' or 'I will have a stick , ' but no , no , no , no .
for me , gum is perfection .
i loathe myself .
oh no , the mendels , they hate all living things , right ?
oh .
hi .
we just found this cat and we are looking for the owner .
he seems to hate you .
are you sure ?
wait a minute .

i looked all over the building and i could not find the kitty anywhere .
oh , i found him .
he was paolo's cat .

because I have heard .
.
.
.
.
.
oh , i see .

i do not want him to wake up alone !
i should go to the hospital !

oh , oh .

I am sorry , i just do not think this , this , this is a good idea .
wait , we will not know that until we do it , will we ?
no , look , uh .
you are upset about your father and you are feeling vulnerable and i just do not feel it would be right , I would feel like I would be , you know , taking advantage of you .
taking advantage ?
I am giving you the advantage , enjoy !
look , I am sure it would be great , but i i think one of us has to be thinking clearly , so , I am going to go !
wow .
ok .
I will see you in the morning  .
mhm mh !
have not had sex in four months , i should get a medal for that !
oh , I am glad .
listen , i want to apologize about chandler , though .
i just did not see this coming .
new york is awesome !
what is with you ?
yeah , I have been to these places before , but I have never really seen them , you know .
yeah , you miss alot , when you are moo ing .
oh !
it was our pleasure .
we are so much enjoying getting to know you .
oh , uhm , okay , uhm , do you mind if we ask you some questions about the father ?
that is great .
how is that now ?
so , what does the other guy do ?
does he go to college too ?
was he falsely accused of something ?
I will bet his dad does not think so .
are you awake ?
of course I am awake .
assume from now on that I am always awake !
alright , we do not know that it is him .
i mean , it could be the football guy .
honey , it is us .
of course it is the shovel killer .
alright , let us say that it is him , would we not want the baby ?
no !
would we treat him any differently ?
I would keep an eye on him !
we have to find out which one the father is .
how ?
i dunno , are not there tests for these things , right ?
yeah , but maybe we are just over reacting .
pff , easy for you to say , he is a father killer .
he probably loves him mommy .
he is probably got a tattoo that says mom  on his shovel wielding arm !
huh , un , blu , bla , flu , flenk !
thank you .
hey joey .
hey !
listen , i feel really badly about yesterday and i thought about it a lot and , and i know , i was too impatient .
so let us try it again .
oh , no , that is okay , i do not need your help .
i worked on it myself and i got to say , i am pretty good !
really , can i hear some of it .
sure , sure .
ok ,  bleu de la bleu , de la blu bla bleu   see ?
well , you are not ,  you are not .
.
.
you are not .
.
.
again , you are not speaking french !
oh well i think i am , yeah and i think I am definitely going to get the part .
how could you possibly think that ?
for one thing , the guy on the tape said i was doing a good job !
hey rach , can you grab me a cup of coffee ?

you have been quiet all morning .
is everything okay ?
hmm hmm .
you sure you are alright ?
yep .

in the future , when a girl asks for some ill advised sympathy sex .
.
.
just do it .
wait , wait ,  you are mad at me about last night ?
i was just trying to do the right thing .
really ?
well , it seems to me if you would done the right thing , i would not have woken up today feeling stupid and embarrassed , i would have woken up feeling comforted and satisfied !
well .
.
.
oh stop that !
i can not believe this .
i was just being a good guy .
i treated you with respect and understanding .
oh , that is so hot .
she walks around him to the other side ) hey , i was looking out for you .
oh , really , well ross , you know what ?
i am a big girl .
i do not need someone telling me what is best for me .
i got to say , i have not had sex a lot of times before , this is the worst ever .
oh , really , really ?
well , it was not very good for me either .
hey you know what ?
you know what ?
to avoid this little thing in the future , let us just say , you and me , never having sex again .

i am never having sex with you again .

oh see , before you uh , when you showed it to me you you held it that way  which uh , which was misleading .
well i m   hello .
chandler .
will you see if your mom can give my resume to dennis phillips ?
because if i can get in a broadway show then i would ve done it all , film , television , and theater .
the only think left would be radio , and that s just for ugly people .
what size shoes do you wear ?
uh , eleven , eleven and a half .
great , because my shoes are giving me a little problem on the dance floor , can i borrow the boots from your costume ?
uh , i don t even really know where i left those .

between me and you  yeah .
in this day and age how dumb do you have to be to get pregnant ?
hey !
y know , sometimes you can do everything right , everyone can wear everything they re supposed to wear , and one of those little guys just gets through !
how ?
i don t know !
maybe they have tools .
well i i talked to and uh , she s definitely going to have this baby .
y know , she said she was going to raise it on her own .
well , maybe that s , maybe that s really brave .
maybe .
i just hope she realizes how hard it s going to be .
maybe she hasn t really thought it through that well .
well , there s a lot to think about .
i mean , how is she , how is she going to handle this financially ?
how is she going to juggle work ?
does she realize she s not going to have a date again for the next eighteen years ?
i don t know .
are you okay ?
uh hmm .
i m just thinking about phoebe ; poor knocked up phoebe .
oh yes !
thank you very much !
oh that s that s actually how the french drink it .

?
ohh , hi , kim .
yeah , remember that thing i told you that happened yesterday ?
well it didn t happen .
okay , two things didn t happen .
remember i told you that someone made out with ralph lauren in the copy room ?
well , it turns out that s not true .
no .
oh no , no , no .
oh god , you think i made out with him .
i i don t want your job .
i i don t .
ohh this is such a mistake .
i did not make out with him .
nobody made out with him .
i did not use my keycard yesterday .
i don t even know how to use my keycard .
mmm hmm .
mmm .
mm hmm .
hmm hmm .
mmm unmm .
hmm hmm hmm .
okay .
i , uh , am from long island .
i i came to the city for college .
um , i , um , have a 5 year old son and in my spare time i like to read spy novels .
but , but , let s talk more about you .
hmm .
so what s really neat .
if you sear the stems of the flowers first in a frying pan , your arrangement will look fresh much longer .
oh my god , joey , that is such a great tip .
monica , could you excuse us for a second ?
i need to talk to the girl with the flowers .
okay .
oh but joey , come over later because i m going to teach you to make a bird feeder out of just a pine cone and some peanut butter .
ohh , i love birds .
what is the matter with you  ?
!
?
what ?
you re arranging flowers !
you got dead flowers !
you got a picture , a picture , of a baby dressed like flowers !
this is not joey !
!
hey .
hey look i am still joey , okay .
flowers they re just , you know , they re nice to look at .
and that happens to be a picture by a famous artist .
of a famous baby .
you re turning into a women .
no i m not .
why would you say that ?
that s just mean .
now i ve upset you ?
what did i say ?
it s not what you said .
it s the way you said it .oh my god , i m a women !
!
!
now , she thinks that i made out with him and i did it to get her job .
but why didn t you just tell her the truth .
i did but she doesn t think anyone would be stupid enough to confuse kenny the copy guy with ralph lauren .
well , hey , what if kenny were the real brains behind the whole company ?
you know .
what if kenny hired that ralph lauren guy to be the pretty front man ?
huh , did she ever think of that ?
you were with kenny today , weren t you ?
just for a second .
ohh , phoebe , what am i going to do ?
well , the only thing you can do .
sleep with ralph lauren .
i m not going to sleep with ralph lauren .
i mean , i could , but i wouldn t .
ohh , sleep with kenny .
that wouldn t help me .
ohh , yes it would .
mmm .
hmm hmm hmm .
me , neither .
i ve had a really good time too , you know .
ohh , i just like the smell .
mmmm .
hmm hmm .
mmm hmm .
how about all the way .
wow , cool poster .
or should i say groovy poster ?
so , ahh , where were we ?
ohh , you can see them , huh ?
i i , did that for you .
what s a matter with me ?
you ve got a black light .
it s 1999 !
kim , hi .
okay  okay .
.
look .
i m sorry that i lied to you before .
you were right .
ralph and i were an item but were not anymore .
yeah , he dumped me .
he said , rachel , i can t do this .
even though you are a very , very , very beautiful women .
i can t do this .
i m married and i m sorry .
and then i don t know why but he said , and you will never get promoted .
especially not above kim , who is an integral cog in the ralph lauren machine .
of course it s true and it hurts so bad .
you and ralph ?
hey , uhh , i need to talk to you .
i m sorry but we ve got to get rid of all this girlie stuff in here .
i , uh , i got to be a man !
okay .
the living room has to remain a guy place , okay ?
that s just the way it has to be .
great great and thanks for being so understanding .
i mean , i didn t want to make a big deal out of this , you know .
you could , uh , put the picture of the famous baby in my room .
i mean , if you want to .
and , uhh , maybe the watering can there .
and a couple of these little tiny boxes .
okay .
what you guys do not understand is , for us , kissing is as important as any part of it .
yeah , right !
.
.
.
.
.
y'serious ?
oh , yeah !
everything you need to know is in that first kiss .
absolutely .
yeah , i think for us , kissing is pretty much like an opening act , y'know ?
i mean it is like the stand up comedian you have to sit through before pink floyd comes out .
yeah , and and it is not that we do not like the comedian , it is that that .
.
.
that is not why we bought the ticket .
the problem is , though , after the concert's over , no matter how great the show was , you girls are always looking for the comedian again , y'know ?
i mean , we are in the car , we are fighting traffic .
.
.
basically just trying to stay awake .
yeah , well , word of advice : bring back the comedian .
otherwise next time you are going to find yourself sitting at home , listening to that album alone .
.
.
are we still talking about sex ?
no , it is good , it is good , it is just that   mm   does not she seem a little angry ?
does she .
marsha , these are cave people .
okay ?
they have issues like 'gee , that glacier's getting kind of close . '
see ?
no .
no .
okay , okay , yes , it is .
how about I will , uh , catch up with you in the ice age .
i .
you look great .
i , uh .
.
.
i hate that .
ah , well , in here , anyone who .
.
.
stands erect .
.
.
so what is new ?
still , uh .
.
.
well .
.
.
you never know .
how is , um .
.
how is the family ?
why   why are you here , carol ?
pregnant ?
!
oh , i think this is the episode of three's company where there is some kind of misunderstanding .
then I have already seen this one !
are you through with that ?
yeah , sorry , the swallowing slowed me down .
whose little ball of paper is this ?
!
oh , uh , that would be mine .
see , i wrote a note to myself , and then i realised i did not need it , so i balled it up and .
.
.
.
now i wish i was dead .
she is already fluffed that pillow .
.
.
monica , you know , you have already fluffed that     but , it is fine !
look  , I am sorry , guys , i just do not want to give them any more ammunition than they already have .
yes , and we all know how cruel a parent can be about the flatness of a child's pillow .
monica   hi !
um , monica , you are scaring me .
i mean , you are like , you are like all chaotic and twirly .
and not not in a good way .
yeah , calm down .
you do not see ross getting all chaotic and twirly every time they come .
that is because as far as my parents are concerned , ross can do no wrong .
y'see , he is the prince .
apparently they had some big ceremony before i was born .
ew , ew , ew , ew ew ew ew ew !
what ?
ugly naked guy got a thighmaster !
has anybody seen my engagement ring ?
yeah , it is beautiful .
oh god , oh god , oh god oh god oh god oh god .
.
.
.
no , look , do not touch that !
oh , like i was not dreading tomorrow enough , having to give it back to him .
.
.
'hi barry !
remember me ?
I am the girl in the veil who stomped on your heart in front of your entire family ! '
oh god and now I am going to have to return the ring , without the ring , which makes it so much harder .
.
.
easy rach , we will find it .
will not we !
alright , when'd'ya have it on last ?
doy !
probably right before she lost it !
you do not get a lot of 'doy ' these days .
.
.
i know i had it this morning , and i know i had it when i was in the kitchen with .
.
.
.
dinah ?
ohhhhh , do not be mad .
.
.
you did not .
oh , i am sorry .
.
.
i gave you one job !
oh , but look how straight those noodles are !
now , monica , you know that is not how you look for an engagement ring in a lasagne .
.
.
i just .
.
.
can not do it .
boys ?
we are going in .
.
.
.
hi .
wow .
that is not a happy hi .
carol's pregnant .
ooh !
i found it !
w w wh   .
.
.
wha   .
.
.
w w w   .
.
.
yeah .
do that for another two hours , you might be where i am right about now .
kind of puts that whole pillow thing in perspective , huh , mon ?
well now , how how do you fit into this whole thing ?
well , carol says she and susan want me to be involved , but if I am not comfortable with it , i do not have to be involved .
.
basically it is entirely up to me .
she is so great !
i miss her .
what does she mean by 'involved ' ?
i mean presumably , the biggest part of your job is done .
anyway , they want me to go down to this   sonogram thing with them tomorrow .
so what are you going to do ?
i have no idea .
no matter what i do , though , I am still going to be a father .
.
.
.
well , this is still ruined , right ?
curry .
i   i think they are great !
i , i really do .
aw , mom .
.
.
I am sorry , why is this girl going to call me ?
no mom , i do not have a restaurant , i work in a restaurant .
ross , could you come and help me with the spaghetti , please ?
yeah .
i know this is going to sound unbelievably selfish , but , were you planning on bringing up the whole baby/lesbian thing ?
because i think it might take some of the heat off me .
what is that supposed to mean ?
no it is not .
so , ross , what is going on with you ?
any stories ?
no news , no little anecdotes to share with the folks ?
okay !
okay .
look , i , uh   i realise you guys have been wondering what exactly happened between carol and me , and , so , well , here is the deal .
carol's a lesbian .
she is living with a woman named susan .
she is pregnant with my child , and she and susan are going to raise the baby .
your folks are really that bad , huh ?
well , y'know , these people are pros .
they know what they are doing , they take their time , they get the job done .
boy , i know they say you can not change your parents , .
.
.
boy , if you could     I would want yours .
must pee .
y'know , it is even worse when you are twins .
you are twins ?
yeah .
we do not speak .
she is like this high powered , driven career type .
what does she do ?
she is a waitress .
all right , you guys , i kind of got to clean up now .
chandler , you are an only child , right ?
you do not have any of this .
well , no , although i did have an imaginary friend , who .
.
.
my parents actually preferred .

.
.

.
mm hmm .
.
a lot .
mm .
so , got any advice ?
y'know , as someone who is recently been   dumped ?
well , you may want to steer clear of the word 'dumped ' .
chances are he is going to be this , this broken she will of a man , y'know , so you should try not to look too terrific , i know it will be hard .
or , y'know , uh , hey !
, I will go down there , and I will give barry back his ring , and you can go with carol and susan to the ob/gyn .
.
.
oh , you have got carol tomorrow .
.

i wish .
no .
after dinner , me , her , and pepper all fell asleep in front of the fire .

so , i picked up a log and threw it on .
or , at least what i thought was a log .
oh my god !

you threw pepper on the fire !
i wish .

fight s over !
excuse me , doug ?
hey there sports fan !
!
no , i ah , i didn t do them .
no , no i just ah , didn t do them .
instead , i ah , hung out with a couple of friends and had a couple of beers so i certainly don t deserve any praise , verbal or otherwise .
doug !
!
i m a little bit uncomfortable with the that way you express yourself .
no , no .
it it s not about the swearing , it s more about ah , the way , that you ah , occasionally , concentrate , your enthusiasm on my buttock .
oh , and don t get me wrong , i appreciate the sentiment .
it s just that i , i have a rather , sensitive posterior , and ah , besides , it s making all the other guys jealous .
okay .
ahhhhh !
okay .
would you rather live in the shirt pocket of a sweaty giant , or inside his shower drain ?
oh my god !
phoebe look , it s ross and that girl .
no !
no !
look at that !
it s a line of ants !
they re working as a team !
phoebe !
right , oh yeah .
wow , oh , it looks like ross is breaking up with her .
uff , i hope he let us her down easy .
let s go .
come on phoebe , look at that !
they are not breaking up , look at them .
okay that s , you know what that is ?
that is a , that is a second date , that s what that is !
look at that , she just put her hand on his thigh .
.
.
oh no !
that really is nothing , she is very sexually aggressive .
ohh !
phoebe , this is all your fault !
now he loves her , he s going to marry her , and this is all your fault .
you said it was okay !
you said she was bald !
!
what ?
!

!
!
phoebe , we can t , we just can t just let it happen !
okay , we have to do something !
we have to break them up !
okay ?
just go in there and like , shave her head !
you owe me one bald girl !
!

thanks .
now what is fabutec ?
okay , all right don t judge me to much .
okay ?
um , but i saw this info mercial , and um , i swear to you i have never ever bought anything on tv before , except for this mop .
but there was this stuff on leg waxing , it just , it looked so amazing .
.
.
.
waxine !
!
yes !
have you seen it ?
oh , it s incredible !
i so want to be a waxine girl .
i know !
!
god .
do think it really doesn t hurt ?
because how can they do that ?
hello !
organic substances recently discovered in the depths of the rain forest !
they have the best stuff in there .
oh my god !
oh my god !
yeah .
we figured when we couldn t find you , you d gone home to make up with rachel .
which is probably what you shoulda done .
huh ?
you think ?
!
god , i , ah , i m in hell .
i mean what , what am i going to do ?
rachel s all like ,  i love you and , and let s work on this .
and all i can think about is ,  what is she going to do ?
what is she going to say ?
when i tell her what i did .
well , before we answer that , i think we should address the more important question .
how dumb are you ?
what ?
!
look , we re trying to rebuild a relationship here , right .
how am i supposed to do that here , without being totally honest with each other ?
look , ross look , i m on board about this totally honesty thing , i am , just not about stuff that s going to get you in trouble .
he s right .
nobody s going to benefit , and you re just going to hurt her .
yeah , and there won t be a relationship left to rebuild .
yeah , but don t you think .
.
.
.
all right look , if you absolutely have to tell her , at least wait until the timing s right .
and that s what deathbeds are for .
yeah , okay .
all right , okay , now , we just have to make sure she doesn t find out some other way .
did you think about the trail ?
what trail ?
the trail from the woman you did it with to the woman you hope never finds out who did it !
you always have to think about the trail !
oh , i i don t think there s any trail .
okay , okay okay , ah , chloe works with that guy issac .
issac s sister is jasmine .
and jasmine works at that message place with phoebe .
and phoebe s friends with rachel .
and that s the trail , i did it !
after applying the waxine and linen strips to leg number one , did that !
grasp one of the linen strips by its  easy grab tab  and pull it off in one quick pain free motion .
okay .
ow !
!
!
!
!
ow oh oh !
was it not pain free ?
no .
it was painful .
oh my god  , they should call it pain zine , now with a little wax .
huh , well , the girls in the satin nighties on the commercial don t seem to think it s that bad .
that s because their nerves are probably deadened from being so stupid .
but hey , y'know if you don t believe me , please , by my guest .
ow ow ow ow !
oh my god !
!
!
now , are you glad we didn t start with the bikini strips ?
chloe ?
hi .
.
you took my watch ?
just you keep it , listen did you , did you tell anyone about us ?
exactly .
so you didn t , didn t mention anything to issac right ?
you tell , of course you do .
issac .
issac .
hey , issac .
issac , hi !
y'know we haven t actually met .
.
.
yes , i suppose i am a dog .
but issac , see i i happen to have a girlfriend .
yeah , that s the one .
listen , i don t want to hurt her .
yeah .
listen , can you keep this information to yourself ?
actually , no , we re not .
no , we re not .
no , we re not !
!
right .
fine .
i just need to know that you re not going to tell your sister .
jasmine ?
we met at phoebe s birthday party , i m , i m ross geller .
yes , i did .
very bad .
i m agreeing with you .
did you , listen , did you happen to tell phoebe yet ?
okay , jasmine , please , please don t .
i love my girlfriend very much , and i want more than anything to just work it out with her .
okay ?
thank you , thank you .
who s your roommate ?
gunther !
gunther .
gunther , please tell me you didn t say anything to rachel about me and the girl from the xerox place .
ow !
oh !
!
ow !
!
ow !
!
ow !
!
!
we re all right .
it s okay , it s okay .
we re all right .
we were just waxing our legs .
off ?
!
!
for your information , this happens to be a pain like no man will ever experience .
yeah , well i don t think you can make that statement , unless you ve been kicked in an area that god only meant to be treated nicely .
yeah , i i think that women just have a lower threshold of pain than men , that s all .
i mean , come on , it s just a little wax .
oh yeah , come here .
oh , that s mature .
okay , fine , so now what , i just pull it off ?
uh huh .
that s right .
come on , rachel , come on !
talk to me !
please !
!
i can t talk to you .
i can t even look at you right now !
what ?
nothing , nothing .
rachel said everything was okay .

rachel ?
just get away from me !
no , it was a mistake !
i made a mistake !
okay ?
a mistake ?
!
what were you trying to put it in ?
her purse ?
!
whe where did he put it ?
!
ross , you had sex with another woman !
oh my god .

yeah , well , i guess they had a fight , and he got drunk .
.
.

yeah , never cheat on rachel .
i m sorry , okay , i m sorry .
i wa i was disgusted with myself , and this morning i was so , i was so upset and then i got your message and i was so happy , and all i wanted was to get her out of my apartment as fast as possible .
whoa !

whoa , whoa , wait a minute .
what time did your little friend leave ?
oh my god .
she was there ?
she was still there ?
she was in there , when i was in there ?
!
listen .
oh hey , hey , the important thing was that she meant , she meant nothing to me !
and yet she was worth jeopardising our relationship !
!
look , i didn t think there was a relationship to jeopardise .
i thought we were broken up .
we were on a break !
that , for all i knew would , could last forever .
that to me is a break up .
you think you re going to get out of this on a technicality ?
look , i m not trying to get out of anything , okay .
i thought our relationship was dead !
well , you sure had a hell of a time at the wake !
y'know what , i don t think we should listen to this anymore .
what , what are you doing ?
you can t go out there .
why not ?
!
i m hungry .
because they ll know we ve been listening .
god !
and to have to hear about it from gunther !
!
come on !
like i wanted him to tell you , i ran all over the place trying to make sure that didn t happen !
oh , that is so sweet .
i think i m falling in love with you all over again .
y'know what , i think we can go out there .
i mean they have more important things to worry about .
yeah , we ll be fine .

wax the door shut , we re never leaving , ever .
hi , it s phoebe .

would you have been able to forgive me ?
yes i would .
you d be okay if you knew that mark had kissed me , and been naked with me , and made love to me ?

and is this in case the house sneezes ?
no , no , that s the ghost for the attic .
i don t want a ghost .

there s the one !
but you did !
i mean , let s be honest .

i just i wish i didn t feel this way about rachel anymore , y know ?
i wish things could go back to normal .
i mean , i love living with her and god , helping out with the baby is just amazing , but now i think i think ross feels left out .
y know ?
when i had to take rachel to the hospital , the doctor thought i was the father .
god  you should ve seen the look on ross s face .
by the way , i have no idea what i m doing here .
for all i know i m just locking it more .
oh hey , did you try opening it with a credit card ?
that s a good idea .
yeah .
okay .
so uh , ross is kind of bummed huh ?
oh , i just i feel terrible .
well , it s not your fault .
what are you going to do ?
not take her to the hospital ?
y know ?
you re doing nothing wrong .
except for harboring an all consuming love for the woman whose carrying his baby .
richard ?
if if you re in there , could you pass me my credit card ?
hey .
hey .

you re crazy !
there s nothing sexual about the noises i make !

oooh .

so  yeah ?
maybe you two should live together .
are you asking me to move out ?
do you not want me here ?
oh no no , no no i love living with you .

but joey , i don t think ross wants me to move into his apartment and disrupt his life like that .
i mean or he does .
no i i i would love to be around for you and the baby .

how did you get to that ?
well , i believe the piece of furniture was fine until your little breakfast adventure with angela delvecchio you knew about that ?
well , let us just say the impressions you made in the butter left little to the imagination .
ok , ok , how about if we split it ?
what do you mean , like , buy it together ?
yeah you think we are ready for something like that ?
why not ?

I am not moving out .
you would tell me if you were moving out right yeah , yeah , it is just that with my last roommate kip .
.

ok , thanks pheebs  oh my god , why have i never tasted these before ?
!
oh , i do not make them a lot because i do not think it is fair to the other cookies all right , well , you are right , these are the best oatmeal cookies I have ever had .
which proves that i never lie .
i guess you do not .
paolo made a pass at me .
so , what do you think ?
i think it is the most beautiful table I have ever seen .
i know !
so how does this work , you going to balance the plates on these little guys ' heads ?
who cares , we will eat at the sink !

heads up ross !

I am so embarrassed , I am the one he hit on !
pheebs , if i had never met him this never would have happened !
no , wait , oh , what are we sorry about ?
i do not know .
right , he is the pig !
such a pig !
oh , god , he is such a pig , oh he is like a .
.
.
he is like a big disgusting .
.
.
.
like a .
.
.
.
pig .
pig man !
yes , good !
ok .
.
.
oh , but he was my pig man .
how did i not see this ?

oh , god .
.
.
should i not have told you ?
no , no , trust , me , it is , it is , it is much better that i know .
uh , i just liked it better before it was better .
.
.
i think she took it pretty well .
you know paolo's over there right now , so .
.
.
we should get over there and see if she is okay .
just one .
second !
score !
game !
come on .
ah .
ooh !
well , looks like , uh , we kicked your butts .
no no , she kicked our butts .
you could be on the olympic standing there team .
come on , two on one .
what are you still doing here ?
she just broke up with the guy , it is time for you to swoop in !
what , now ?
yes , now is when you swoop !
you got to make sure that when paolo walks out of there , the first guy rachel sees is you , she is got to know that you are everything he is not !
you are like , like the anti paolo !
my catholic friend is right .
she is distraught .
you are there for her .
you pick up the pieces , and then you usher in the age of ross !
how is it going ?
do not stare .
now she just finished throwing his clothes off the balcony , now there is just a lot of gesturing and arm waving ,  , ok , that is either , how could you ?
or , enormous breasts !
here he comes !
ooh !
oh , ok bye bye .
paolo , i really hate you for what you did to rachel ,  but i still have five of these , so heat it at 375 until the cheese bubbles .
paolo , i i just want to tell you and i think i speak for everyone when i say .
.
.
oh , just look at her .
.
.
oh you guys , i i really think just one of us should go out there so she is not overwhelmed .
.
.
oh , you are right .
.
and i really think it should be me .
hey .
hey .
you all right ?
ooh , I have been better .
.
.
come here .
listen , you deserve so much better than him .
you know , i mean , you , you , you should be with a guy who knows what he has when he has you .
oh , ross .
.
.
what ?
i am so sick of guys .
i do not want to look at another guy , i do not want to think about another guy , i do not even want to be near another guy .

oh .
.
.
you ok ?
.
medium .
hmm .
any cookies left ?
yep !
see , rach , uh , see , i do not think that swearing off guys altogether is the answer .
i really do not .
i think that what you need is to develop a more sophisticated screening process .
no .
i just need to be by myself for a while , you know ?
i just got to figure out what i want uh , no , no , see , because not .
not all guys are going to be a paolo .

this baby has got everything .
take y know , locations for instance .
first , organized alphabetically , then geographically , then by square footage .

umm , do you know each other s hometowns ?

but wh what s wrong with monica and chandler ?
nothing why ?

of course you can look at it !
yeah , i want your opinion too !
okay .
here you go !
what do you think about centerpieces ?
centerpieces !

uh huh !

zelda looked at the chimney sweep .
her father , the vicar  the vicar ?

her loins were burning .
she threw caution to the wind and reached out and grabbed his  whoa !
whoa ho ho ho !

uh , phoebe  oh ross , hi .
phoebe , what are you doing ?
i m sorry , i m with a client right now .
phoebe !

phoebe , you can t massage people in my apartment !
what s the big deal ?
i did it at monica and chandler s !
and they knew about it ?
okay , well ross , what is this really about ?
look , this is my home and i want to be able to come and go whenever i want !
okay , i will find someplace else to do the rest of my appointments .
i just don t know what the big deal is !
the big deal is i don t want naked , greasy strangers in my apartment when i want to kick back with a puzzle beer !
cold beer .
hey joey , what  cha doing ?
sweepin  .
why ?

joey , what what are you doing going into my bedroom ?
!
okay , look i m sorry , i went in there to take a nap and i know i shouldn t have , but you got porn !
hey hey , y know what ?
i don t care !
i m not ashamed of my book .
there s nothing with a woman enjoying a little erotica .
it s just a healthy expression of female sexuality , which by the way , you will never understand .
you got porn !
hello .
uh no no , she she s out for the night .
can i , can i help you with something ?
yes i am .
oh yeah , i should probably call them .
oh , i don t think i ever heard that story .
oh dad , really you don t need to  what a sweet story .
well , at least you re not hearing it for the first time at your fifth grade halloween party .
anyway , we re really excited about our wedding plans , and well i guess pretty soon we ll be making a big withdrawal from the monica wedding fund .
what ?
what happened ?
you still have the monica wedding fund don t you ?
i don t believe you spent my wedding fund on the beach house !
you bought the beach house when i was 23 !
what about when i started dating chandler ?
clearly i did not start drinking enough at the start of the meal .
i can t believe it !
that there is no money for my wedding ?
!
okay !
now , i m going to touch you .
ohh , that s soft .
i can t believe this .
do you think that your parents could help pay for it ?

he could not even tell me !
he said it was just some sort of skin .
.
.
abnormality .
and the worst thing is he he he said , he said , without being able to identify it , he was reluctant to remove it .
y'know what ?
you should go to my guy , because when i went in there with my third nipple .
he just lopped it right off .
y'know ?
so i guess I am lucky .
i mean not as lucky as people who were born with two nipples .
at least they knew what yours was .
y'know , yours had a name .
oh !
maybe they will name yours after you !
y'know , they will call it , the ross .
and then people would be like , awww , he is got a ross .
yeah , that would be cool !
pete's breaking up with me .
i just checked my messages , and he said that when he gets back from atlanta , we need to talk .
and ?
well that is it .
people never say `we need to talk ' unless it is something bad .
whoa , that does not necessarily mean that he is breaking up with you .
really ?

yeah , maybe he just cheated on you .
that is so great !
oh , i .

okay ?
th th that is all it is , a third nipple .
y'know ?

you can take it off .
just slice that baby right off !
just showing you my run of the mill slice it right off third nipple .
no ?
well then , what is it ?

i got to go water pete's plants .
y'know what , if he is going to break up with me , maybe i will not water his plants .

if y'know what i mean .
or ha ha , we could go over there and pee on them .
and i i can not take it !
y'know ?
I am just , always afraid one of them is going to catch me with the other one .
it is making me crazy .
well honey , then why do not you break up with one of them ?
uh .
whoa whoa whoa .
what ah , what happened to playing the field ?

clearly i have feelings for him , but feelings don t mean love !

you all know ?
does ross know ?
oh no , ross doesn t know anything .
oh , i can not believe you didn t tell me !

whoa whoa what ?
you found a place ?
she said what ?
postpone it ?
emily , do you think monica realises how much our parents spent on this wedding ?
do you my sister s teeny tiny little brain comprehends that people took time out of their lives to fly thousands of miles to be here , huh ?
this isn t right .
i can t ask people to do that ?
would you ask people to do that ?
the only thing i understand is ; postponing it is not an option .
this is when we re getting married .
no .
i m saying it s now .
there s no  or  in mind .
what is wrong with these pants ?
!

you can ?
yeah .
i just need you to bring me some photos of ross .
um hmm .
and a small piece of chocolate .
okay .
and a glass of tepid water .
ooh , is this one of those things where you throw it in a bag with some graveyard dirt and hang it from a north facing tree ?
uh , only if you have the hiccups too .
yeah , the pictures are for you , the water and the chocolate is for me .
i just didn t feel like getting up .
okay , i m going to show you a picture of ross .

i can do that .
i certainly did it when we were going out .

i don t know , i told her it was stupid to put off the wedding just because the hall was gone and she liked flipped out .
oh my god .
you re even dumber than i am !
excuse me ?
ross , how long have you been planning this wedding ?
i don t know .
a month ?
emily has probably been planning it since she was five !
ever since the first time she took a pillowcase and hung it off the back of her head .
that s what we did !
we dreamed about the perfect wedding , and the perfect place , with the perfect four tiered wedding cake  , with the little people on top .
thanks .
but the most important part is that we had the perfect guy who understood just how important all that other stuff was .
i had no idea .
and that that pillowcase thing , i thought you guys were just doing the flying nun .
sometimes we were .
come on .
you got to help me figure out what to do .
okay ?
okay .
come on .
that was pretty intense huh ?
yeah .
hey , i hope ross didn t think that we just went in there because we were uncomfortable being out here !
i hope he did !
hello .

I am going to make them stay here .
joey , you can not make someone do something they do not want to do .
believe me , there is something I have been trying to get mike to do in bed and there is .

i am not going to help you do that !
goodbye !
hi , I am here to see mr campbell .

.
.
but my boss cannot see me .
I am interviewing for another job .
sssshhhh !

whatever happened to just singing for no reason ?

this place is so depressing .
if i had to work here I would kill myself .

you are fun .
okay , well , i just do not , i do not know how it works exactly .
see , my name is buffay and my husband's name is hannigan , so is it supposed to be buffay hannigan or hannigan buffay ?

.
.
oh , this could take a while .
okay .
hey !
hey pheebs .
oh , not anymore .
i changed it today .
oh , I am sorry , mrs hannigan .
wrong again !
apparently you can change it to anything you want .
so i thought , all right , here is an opportunity to be creative .
so meet princess consuela banana hammock .
that is what we were going to name the baby .
phoebe !
uh !
princess consuela .
you seriously changed your name to that ?
uh huh !
okay , so from now on we have to call you princess consuela ?
uhm , no .
I am going to have my friends call me valerie .
hey , how did the interview go ?
oh !
it is not good .
you know , i always feel that way after an interview .
I will bet it went better than you think .
well , i did not get the job at gucci and i got fired from ralph lauren .
that is a bad interview .
what are you , what are you talking about ?
how did this happen ?
well , my boss was at the same restaurant where i was having my interview and he heard everything .
so later he calls me to his office and he tells me that he is going to have to let me go , because I am not a team player .
and i said wait a minute !
yes i am .
and i had to sit there for 45 minutes while he proved that that in fact .
.
.
was true .
oh god .
I am so sorry .
hey !
wha hoo !
what is this ?
well it is a , it is a bottle of champagne .
why is this here ?
ross .
.
.
i guess it is here because i got tenure !
this is the single greatest day of my professional career .
gunther , six glasses !
oh , i thought joey was here .
five is good .
well , I am going to have a loogie in my coffee tomorrow .
ooh !
israeli champagne .
and it is vanilla !
i got tenure .
i did not win the lottery .
.
.
hey rach , so uh .
.

how did your thing go ?
oh it .
.
.
good !

oh , you know what ?
you are going to get it .
i i i i can feel it .
can you ?
ah , all right .
here is to ross !
and and to years of hard work finally paying off .
and to knowing that your career does not mean everything .
but also knowing it means a lot .
but more importantly to full well rounded lives .
.
that center around work .
to ross !
you know what the best part about this is ?
i can never be fired .
oh god !
no seriously .
i have job security for life .
you know , i never have to worry .
oh , look at you .

what ?
fungus !
yeah .
place is full of it .
no it is not .
we had an inspection and they did not find anything .
okay .

maybe because it is you hung your head out of the window like a dog the whole ride here .
maybe .
so this is the living room huh ?
ooh , it is pretty dark .
no it is not !
are you kiddin ' ?
i think i just saw a bat in the corner !
when your head was hanging out the window , it did not hit a mailbox , did it ?
maybe .
well , i just think you guys can do better than this house , you know ?
or any other house for that matter .
oh joey , look , we know you are having a hard time with this , but we really , we love it here .
fine , ok , if you love this house so much , then you should just live here , okay ?

finally , i figure I would better answer it , and it turns out it is my mother , which is very very weird , because   she never calls me !
hi .
this guy says hello , i want to kill myself .

i just feel like someone reached down my throat , grabbed my small intestine , pulled it out of my mouth and tied it around my neck .
.

and you never knew she was a lesbian .
.
.
no !

okay ?

why does everyone keep fixating on that ?
she did not know , how should i know ?
sometimes i wish i was a lesbian .
.
.
did i say that out loud ?
i told mom and dad last night , they seemed to take it pretty well .
oh really , so that hysterical phone call i got from a woman at sobbing 3:00 a.m .
, I will never have grandchildren , I will never have grandchildren .

i do not want to be single , okay ?
i just .
.
.
i just   i just want to be married again !
and i just want a million dollars !
rachel ?
!
oh god monica hi !
thank god !
i just went to your building and you were not there and then this guy with a big hammer said you might be here and you are , you are !
de caff .
okay , everybody , this is rachel , another lincoln high survivor .
this is everybody , this is chandler , and phoebe , and joey , and   you remember my brother ross ?
hi , sure !
hi .
so you want to tell us now , or are we waiting for four wet bridesmaids ?
oh god .
.
.
well , it started about a half hour before the wedding .
i was in the room where we were keeping all the presents , and i was looking at this gravy boat .
this really gorgeous lamauge gravy boat .
when all of a sudden   sweet 'n ' lo ?
i realized that i was more turned on by this gravy boat than by barry !
and then i got really freaked out , and that is when it hit me : how much barry looks like mr .
potato head .
y'know , i mean , i always knew looked familiar , but .
.
.
anyway , i just had to get out of there , and i started wondering 'why am i doing this , and who am i doing this for ? '
.
so anyway i just did not know where to go , and i know that you and i have kind of drifted apart , but you are the only person i knew who lived here in the city .
who was not invited to the wedding .
ooh , i was kind of hoping that would not be an issue .
.
.
[scene : monica's apartment , everyone is there and watching a spanish soap on tv and are trying to figure out what is going on . ]
now I am guessing that he bought her the big pipe organ , and she is really not happy about it .
tuna or egg salad ?
decide !
I will have whatever christine is having .
daddy , i just .
.
.
i can not marry him !
I am sorry .
i just do not love him .
well , it matters to me !
if i let go of my hair , my head will fall off .
ooh , she should not be wearing those pants .
i say push her down the stairs .
c'mon daddy , listen to me !
it is like , it is like , all of my life , everyone has always told me , 'you are a shoe !
you are a shoe , you are a shoe , you are a shoe ! '
.
and today i just stopped and i said , 'what if i do not want to be a shoe ?
what if i want to be a   a purse , y'know ?
or a   or a hat !
no , I am not saying i want you to buy me a hat , I am saying i am a ha   it is a metaphor , daddy !
you can see where he would have trouble .
look daddy , it is my life .
well maybe I will just stay here with monica .
well , i guess we have established who is staying here with monica .
.
.
well , maybe that is my decision .
well , maybe i do not need your money .
wait !
!
wait , i said maybe !
!
just breathe , breathe .
.
that is it .
just try to think of nice calm things .
.
.
raindrops on roses and rabbits and kittens ,  bluebells and sleighbells and   something with mittens .
.
.
la la la la .
something and noodles with string .
these are a few .
.
.
I am all better now .
i helped !
okay , look , this is probably for the best , y'know ?
independence .
taking control of your life .
the whole , 'hat ' thing .
and hey , you need anything , you can always come to joey .
me and chandler live across the hall .
and he is away a lot .
joey , stop hitting on her !

the worst thing i ever did was , i i shredded by boyfriend's favorite bath towel .
that is right .
[scene : monica's apartment , rachel is talking on the phone and pacing . ]
barry , I am sorry .
.
.
i am so sorry .
.
.
i know you probably think that this is all about what i said the other day about you making love with your socks on , but it is not .
.
.
it is not , it is about me , and i ju    hi , machine cut me off again .
.
.
anyway .
look , look , i know that some girl is going to be incredibly lucky to become mrs .
barry finkel , but it is not me , it is not me .
and not that i have any idea who me is right now , but you just have to give me a chance too .
.
.
I am divorced !
I am only 26 and I am divorced !
shut up !
you must stop !
that only took me an hour .
look , ross , you got to understand , between us we have not had a relationship that has lasted longer than a mento .
you , however have had the love of a woman for four years .
four years of closeness and sharing at the end of which she ripped your heart out , and that is why we do not do it !
i do not think that was my point !
you know what the scariest part is ?
what if there is only one woman for everybody , y'know ?
i mean what if you get one woman   and that is it ?
unfortunately in my case , there was only one woman   for her .
.
.
what are you talking about ?
'one woman ' ?
that is like saying there is only one flavor of ice cream for you .
lemme tell you something , ross .
there is lots of flavors out there .
there is rocky road , and cookie dough , and bing !
cherry vanilla .
you could get  them with jimmies , or nuts , or whipped cream !
this is the best thing that ever happened to you !
you got married , you were , like , what , eight ?
welcome back to the world !
grab a spoon !
i honestly do not know if I am hungry or horny .
stay out of my freezer !
[scene : a restaurant , monica and paul are still eating . ]

.
.
.
.
.
what , you want to spell it out with noodles ?
oh , so there is going to be a fifth date ?
yeah .
.
.
yeah , i think there is .
what were you going to say ?
oh god , oh god , i am sorry .
.
.
i am so sorry .
.
.
i know being spit on is probably not what you need right now .
um .
.
.
how long ?
wow !
I am I am I am glad you smashed her watch !
.
yeah .
yeah , i do .
oh .
see .
.
.
but joanne loved chachi !
that is the difference !
grab a spoon .
do you know how long it is been since I have grabbed a spoon ?

great story !
but , i uh , i got to go , i got a date with andrea   angela   andrea .
.
.
oh man ,  angela's the screamer , andrea has cats .
right .
thanks .

I am outta here .
y'know , here is the thing .
even if i could get it together enough to   to ask a woman out , .
.
.
who am i going to ask ?
is not this amazing ?
i mean , i have never made coffee before in my entire life .
that is amazing .
congratulations .
y'know , i figure if i can make coffee , there is not anything i can not do .
if can invade poland , there is not anything i can not do .
listen , while you are on a roll , if you feel like you got to make like a western omelet or something .
.
.
although actually I am really not that hungry .
.
.
oh good , lenny and squigy are here .
morning , paul .
hello , paul .
hi , paul , is it ?
stop !
we will talk later .
that was not a real date ?
!
what the hell do you do on a real date ?
shut up , and put my table back .
all right , kids , i got to get to work .
if i do not input those numbers , .
.
.
it does not make much of a difference .
.
.
so , like , you guys all have jobs ?
yeah , we all have jobs .
see , that is how we buy stuff .
yeah , I am an actor .
wow !
would i have seen you in anything ?
i doubt it .
mostly regional work .
oh wait , wait , unless you happened to catch the reruns ' production of pinocchio , at the little theater in the park .
look , it was a job all right ?
'look , gippetto , I am a real live boy . '
i will not take this abuse .
you are right , I am sorry .
once i was a wooden boy , a little wooden boy .
.
.
you should both know , that he is a dead man .
oh , chandler ?
so how you doing today ?
did you sleep okay ?
talk to barry ?
i can not stop smiling .
i can see that .
you look like you slept with a hanger in your mouth .
i know , he is just so , so .
.
.
do you remember you and tony demarco ?
oh , yeah .
well , it is like that .
with feelings .
oh wow .
are you in trouble .
big time !
want a wedding dress ?
hardly used .
i think we are getting a little ahead of selves here .
okay .
okay .
i am just going to get up , go to work and not think about him all day .
or else I am just going to get up and go to work .
oh , look , wish me luck !
what for ?
I am going to go get one of those  job things .
hey frannie , welcome back !
how was florida ?
how do you do that ?
you know paul ?
you mean you know paul like i know paul ?
of course it was a line !
why ?
!
why ?
why , why would anybody do something like that ?
i assume we are looking for an answer more sophisticated than 'to get you into bed ' .
i hate men !
i hate men !
oh no , do not hate , you do not want to put that out into the universe .
is it me ?
is it like i have some sort of beacon that only dogs and men with severe emotional problems can hear ?
all right , c'mere , give me your feet .
i just thought he was nice , y'know ?
i can not believe you did not know it was a line !
guess what ?
you got a job ?
are you kidding ?
I am trained for nothing !
i was laughed out of twelve interviews today .
and yet you are surprisingly upbeat .
you would be too if you found john and david boots on sale , fifty percent off !
oh , how well you know me .
.
.
they are my new 'i do not need a job , i do not need my parents , I have got great boots ' boots !
how did you pay for them ?
uh , credit card .
and who pays for that ?
um .
.
.
my .
.
.
father .
oh god , come on you guys , is this really necessary ?
i mean , i can stop charging anytime i want .
c'mon , you can not live off your parents your whole life .
i know that .
that is why i was getting married .
give her a break , it is hard being on your own for the first time .
thank you .
you are welcome .
i remember when i first came to this city .
i was fourteen .
my mom had just killed herself and my step dad was back in prison , and i got here , and i did not know anybody .
and i ended up living with this albino guy who was , like , cleaning windshields outside port authority , and then he killed himself , and then i found aromatherapy .
so believe me , i know exactly how you feel .
the word you are looking for is 'anyway ' .
.
.
all right , you ready ?
no .
no , no , I am not ready !
how can i be ready ?
hey , rach !
you ready to jump out the airplane without your parachute ?
come on , i can not do this !
you can , i know you can !
i do not think so .
come on , you made coffee !
you can do anything !
c'mon , cut .
cut , cut , cut , .
.
.
y'know what ?
i think we can just leave it at that .
it is kind of like a symbolic gesture .
.
.
rachel !
that was a library card !
y'know , if you listen closely , you can hear a thousand retailers scream .
welcome to the real world !
it sucks .
you are going to love it !
well , that is it  you going to crash on the couch ?
no .
no , i got to go home sometime .
you be okay ?
yeah .
hey mon , look what i just found on the floor .

that is paul's watch .
you just put it back where you found it .
oh boy .
alright .
goodnight , everybody .
mmm .
oh , no   sorry   no no no , go   no , you have it , really , i do not want it   split it ?
okay .
okay .
you know you probably did not know this , but back in high school , i had a , um , major crush on you .
i knew .
you did !
oh .
.
.
.
i always figured you just thought i was monica's geeky older brother .
i did .
oh .
listen , do you think   and try not to let my intense vulnerability become any kind of a factor here   but do you think it would be okay if i asked you out ?
sometime ?
maybe ?
yeah , maybe .
.
.
okay .
.
.
okay , maybe i will .
.
.
goodnight .
goodnight .

me too .
I am good at it .

oh , oh .
.
.

well , i officially give you permission to break the pact .
thank you .
all right , here i go .
hey , remember how scary it used to be going up to girls in college ?

hmmmm .
.
.
raunchy !
seriously pheebs , it is not going to be that kind of a party .

hey , you know , some of those are pretty hard !
like why would there be a ghost in my fridge ?
.
yeah !
so , saturday night !

oh , well , uh , this is going to sound kind of silly , but , do you remember my roommate chandler bing ?
it is been sixteen years but the air quotes still hurt .
that is ok .
uh , anyway , well he and i both really liked you a lot , uhm , but we did not want anything to jeopardize our friendship , so we kind of made a pact , that neither of us could ask you out !
yeah , why ?
you did ?
and on my turf ?
hey , where is this guy , it is been over an hour !
well , he is coming from jersey , he said he would get here as fast as he could !
who is it ?
uh !

.
.
.
if you say so .
oh , god !
rachel ?
yeah ?

how old is your phonebook ?
oh my god , this man is going to get naked in my apartment !
oh god no , i do not want to see him take his clothes off !
oh , no !
i mean , obviously we want to see you take your clothes off !

shocking !
three hundred dollars , are you kidding ?
no , that is ok , let us me just get my check book !
no , you are not going to pay him , he did not do anything !
i do not care .
we are not paying you 300 dollars for this .
oh yeah , okay .
I am uptight .

I am sorry , did you say all man or old man ?
uh , look , officer .
.

that did not make us sound gay at all !
you broke the pact !
ross , that was 16 years ago !
that does not matter !
we are talking about the foundation of our friendship .
i believe the foundation of our friendship was unfortunate hair .
all right , look , if we are really going to do this .

two guys in one night ?
wow , i thought she became a slut after she got her nose fixed .
seriously , where did this happen ?
okay , after you told me she was passed out in our room , i went in there to make sure she was all right .
she was lying on my bed , all buried in peoples coats .
well , i went to kiss her on the forehead , you know .
but it was so dark , i accidentally got her lips .
i started to pull away , but then i felt her start to kiss me back .
it was only for a second , but .
.
.
it was amazing .
and now , now i find out that you kissed her first .
oh wait .
.
.
what bed did you say she was on ?
mine .
I am pretty sure i put her on my bed .

joey , we had a deal .
that that s why you re here !
i ve got to fire you !

but it was a different joke than i thought it wasn t that funny .
so i m still torn .
well look , you don t really like the one from uptown and you re too exhausted from dating the one up in poughkeepsie , so i say you just end them both .
okay ?
you take a train up to poughkeepsie and break up with her , and on your way back you break up with uptown .

oh sure okay , you can touch yourself in front of us but you can t talk to rachel .
what ?
!
when have i ever touched myself in front of you guys ?
oh please !
just before when you were asleep in the lounge !
that armenian family was watching you instead of the tv .
oh , that reminds me .
that mr .
hasmeje still has my gameboy .
hey chandler , can i talk to you for a second ?
sure .
dude i just did something terrible .
that was you ?
!
i thought it was jack !
no !
no , that was jack !
rachel thinks i asked her to marry me !
what ?
!
why does she think that ?
because it kind of looked like i did .
again , what ?
!
okay well , i was down on one knee with the ring in my hand  as we all are at some point during the day .
it wasn t my ring !
it fell out of ross s jacket !
and when i knelt down to pick it up rachel thought i was proposing !
ross had a ring ?
!
and he was going to propose ?
i guess .
and you did it first ?
!
this is going to kill him !
you know how much he loves to propose !
i know !
i know it s awful .
well , what did she say ?
she said yes .
does ross know ?
oh god , what the hell am i going to tell him ?
well maybe you don t have to tell him anything .
oh , i like that .
yeah  if you clear things up with rachel then ross never needs to find out , but you have to do it now before he hears about it and kicks your ass !
now let s not get carried away .
i want a baby .
honey , we ve been over this .
i need to be facing the other way .
come on !
come on , if we have sex again it ll double our chances of getting pregnant .
do you think that closet s still available ?
i m so tired .
yeah okay , but no foreplay .
deal !
dad seriously !
y know you really should see someone about that !
i want to go talk to rachel for a minute , are you going to be okay alone for a bit ?
actually umm   hey !
hi .
are you all right ?
uhh  i think i just got engaged .
oh my god !
he did it ?
well did you know he was going to ask me ?
are you kidding ?
i m like the one who talked him into it .
i like to think of myself as the puppet master of the group .
and you really think this is a good idea ?
i just talked him into it , don t tell me i have to do you too .
the puppet master gets tired people .
i just don t know !
it just doesn t feel right .
why ?
!
you two are so meant to be together , everybody thinks so .
really ?
!
even ross ?
especially ross !
oh uh , hey pheebs .
uh y know what ?
i ll i ll come back later .
wow !
kind of uh , kind of a full house here .
i ll guess just i ll come back .
there he goes , your fianc e .
i guess so .
although he does play with himself in his sleep .
i can t say that i m surprised .
dad , what are you doing ?
it can t be me , i m standing right here .
no !
y know what ?
i don t like you without mom .
come on .
we re not peeking ?
hello sir , you know monica .
hey uh , is it okay to come in ?
of course !
oh joey , this ring i it s beautiful i love it !
yeah uh look rach , there s something i got to tell ya .
hey !
yeah !
hi emma .
hey , why do you think she won t take my breast ?
yowsa !
okay sweetie , you can do it .
just open up and put it in your mouth .
dear lord .
i m sorry honey , what were you saying ?
oh uh uh yeah , i think that  oh look , she s pulling away again !
do you think my nipples are too big for her mouth ?
she looks scared .
doesn t she look scared ?
y know , i don t really know her .
are you kidding me ?
!
it s just so frustrating !
why doesn t she want my breast ?
!
i don t know !
maybe she s crazy !
oh hey !
wait up !
hi !
congratulations !
i didn t want to say anything in front of joey  because i didn t know if he knew yet .
what , that we had a baby ?
come on let s give him a little credit , although , he did eat a piece of plastic fruit earlier .
no !
no , that you and rachel are engaged !
what ?
oh , it s a secret .
oh goodie !
yes !
we haven t done the secret thing in a long time .
phoebe , there is no secret .
okay ?
i didn t propose .
are you lying ?
is this like that time you tried to convince us that you were a doctor ?
i am a doctor !
y know what ?
i m just going to go and talk to rachel myself .
all right , me too .
should we wake her up ?
no !
no , come on let her sleep !
she s so exhausted .
and so engaged .
what ?
oh my god !
she she thinks we re engaged !
why ?
why ?
why would she think we re engaged ?
!
perhaps because you gave her an engagement ring ?
y know ross doctors are supposed to be smart .
i didn t give her that ring !
really ?
no !
so whose ring is it ?
it s mine .
is it an engagement ring ?
yes !
but you didn t give it to her ?
no !
but you were going to propose ?
no !
!
huh , i might be losing interest in this .
look .
look , my mom gave me that ring because she wanted me to propose to rachel , but all i wanted to do is if she maybe kind of wanted ah start things up again .
oh , what beautiful lukewarm sentiment .
look , i didn t want to rush into anything .
and it seemed like she didn t want to either .
but i don t , i don t understand how any of this happened !
what ?
did she find the ring in my jacket , assume that i was going to propose , throw it on , and and just start telling people ?
no !
no , she said you actually proposed to her .
well i didn t !
i didn t propose !
unless uh   did i ?
i haven t slept in forty hours and it does sound like something i would do .
look , we can t stay in here forever .
oh , i still can t believe my dad saw us having sex !
he didn t make it to one of piano recitals , but this he sees !
this is okay .
we re all adults here ; there s nothing to be ashamed of .
now , let s put our underwear in our pockets and walk out the door .
hi dad !
i can still call you that right ?
i just want you to know that what you witnessed in there , that wasn t for fun .
it wasn t fun ?
!
why ?
why why would you wh why   look , i just don t want you to think that we re animals who do it whenever we want .
the truth is , dad , we re we re trying .
yeah , we re trying to get pregnant .
well , that s okay dad , we we can wait until later .
daddy ?
!
that s funny , this conversation s how i got the bullet hole in my head .
daddy !
i don t think we need to hear about the specific positions you and mom had sex .
i don t feel good right now .
seriously sir , my brains ?
all over the wall .
hey .
hey .
i need to tell you something .
well , now s a good time .
i m on my way to have my ears cut off .
joey asked me marry him .

she had the ring on , she seemed so excited , and then she took her breast out .
joey , you have to tell her what s going on !
and what did it look like ?
!
i didn t look at it .
stupid baby s head was blocking most of it .

I am sorry , but I am not hanging all my hopes of rachel and i living together on on probably !
y know ?
you got to take care of yourselves !
in this world history teaches us nothing !

um , we have a reservation under the name chandler bing .

everybody wants to be paid off .
right , calm down , of'mally .
I will slip him some money .

right , um , but , on hanukkah , hanukkah is a celebration of a miracle .
see , years and years ago there were these people called the maccabees .
okay , that is right , yes , but on hanukkah , uh , we sing , uh  dreidel , dreidel , dreidel , i made you out of clay .
okay , it is not a contest .
well , how about this year , instead of santa , we have fun celebrating hanukkah ?

thank you gunther , put it there .
definitely not easier with coins .
thank you .
thank you .
hey pheebs !
hey !
here .
now i only owe you $49.50 .
hey pheebs !
hey !
if you want to give joey a christmas present that disrupts the entire building , why not get him something a little bit more subtle , like a wrecking ball , or a vile of small pox to release in the hallway ?
it is not just the drum noise .
every five minutes , joey throws his sticks in the air , and i have to hear , oh my eye !
oh god , my eye !
i mean , it is so annoying .
yes , thank you .
you see , this is how normal people are supposed to react to drums .
phoebe , you got joey drums to annoy rachel , so she would not want to live there anymore ?
maybe on some level .
joey , y know that you could just not throw the sticks up in the air .
what is rock 'n ' roll about that ?
hey , joey , i got you another present .
oh wait , before you tell me what it is !
okay , what is it ?
it is a tarantula !
oh !
god !
rachel , look , I am sorry .
what was i thinking giving joey this big , gross , scary spider in such a poorly constructed cage ?
what are you talking about ?
i love them !
yeah , i had a tarantula when i was a kid .
but it it died , because my cat ate it .
and then , then my cat died .
but joey , is not this cool ?
is it on me ?
i feel , i feel like it is on me !
i got , hey !
oh , is not that adorable ?
joey is afraid of the tarantula .
ah , yeah , he is so adorable , god , he is just so much fun , joey is the best , I am glad you are having so much fun here .
what ?
wait wait a minute , what ?
phoebe , what is the matter ?
our apartment is ready .
and that makes you angry because  because you would rather live here with joey .
where did you get that ?
monica and chandler said that you were having so much fun here .
and apparently no amount of drums or tarantulas is going to change that .
phoebe ?
hm ?
did you get all this stuff for joey to try and drive me out of the apartment ?
honey , if you wanted to do that , you might as well just gotten him a fish , you know how fish freaked me out !
fish !
it would not have mattered anyway , phoebe , you and i are , are going to live together , we are roommates ; that is the deal .
yes , but i wanted you to want to live with me , but okay , if you are having so much fun over here  oh , it is so much more fun with you .
we did have fun , did not we ?
we did !
oh , anyway , they say , if we want , we can see it tonight .
oh , i would love to !
yay , okay !
good , good , good , good , good .
great , all right , okay , and monica ask me to make the drumming stop .
um .
.
.
done !
hey !
no , these are my pants .
well , uh , do you have a santa outfit left ?
okay look , do do , you have anything christmassy ?
i promised my son , and i really do not want to disappoint him , um , come on , i uh , you got to have something .
I am the holiday armadillo !
I am a friend of santa's and he sent me here to wish you  a merry christmas !
what happened to santa , holiday armadillo ?
santa was unavailable so close to christmas .
wow , come in , have a seat .
you must be exhausted coming all the way from texas .
that is right , ben .
I am santa's representative for all the southern states .
and mexico !
but , santa sent me here to give you these presents , ben .
maybe the lady will help me with these presents .
you are welcome , ben .
merry christmas , ooh , and happy hanukkah !
you are ?
me , too !
because armadillos also wandered in the desert ?
you want to wander in the hall ?
ooh , hey ben , what if the holiday armadillo told you all about the festival of lights ?
yeah !
come on ben .
years and years ago there were these people called the maccabees .
.
.
ho , ho , ho !
merry christmas !
hey !
what are you doing here , santa ?
well , I am here to see my old buddy ben .
what are you doing here , weird turtle man ?
I am the holiday armadillo , your part jewish friend .
you sent me here to give ben some presents .
remember ?
what ?
you bet i did , ben , put it there !
well , it would have worked this time , if his hands were not so damn small !
ho , ho , ho !
okay ben , why do not you come open some more presents , and santa , the armadillo , and i have a little talk in the kitchen ?
there is a sentence , i never thought I would say .
what are you doing ?
you called everyone and said you were having trouble finding a santa costume , so i borrowed one from a guy at work !
thank you , but , but you got to leave .
why ?
because , I am finally getting him excited about hanukkah , and , and you are you re wrecking it .
but i did not get to shape my belly like a bowl full of jelly .
I am sorry , chandler but this , this is really important to me .
fine , I will give the suit back .
hey , you think , you can keep it another night ?
santa ?
really ?
yes , is that okay ?
did your dad ever dress up like santa ?
no .
then it is okay !
okay ben , santa has to go .
say good bye !
because , if santa and the holiday armadillo ?
.
are ever in the same room for too long the universe will implode .
merry christmas !
fine , i i give up .
santa , santa can stay .
well , I will stay , but only because i want to hear about hanukkah .
ben , will you sit here with santa and learn about hanukkah ?
all right , it is time for the story of hanukkah .
years and years ago , there were these people called the maccabees .
merry christmas !
oh wow !
look at this place !
oh , this is terrible .
oh , they ve made so many changes i can t even feel my grandmother s presence anymore ooh !
new sconces !
oh my god !
what ?
okay , remember uh , remember how you told me that your grandmother put up that wall to make that into two bedrooms ?
yeah ?
and remember how you always said you were afraid the landlord would find out and then tear it down ?
yeah ?
do you really not know where i m going with this ?
it left !
it s one huge room !
oh no !
oh !
wow !
!
!
see ?
well , i guess we ll just have to put the wall back up .
you can t , because of the new skylight !
there s a skylight ?
!
wow !
!
so what should we do ?
should we start looking for a new place ?
y know i m i m sensing that um , my grandmother would not be comfortable with that .
oh yeah ?
startin  to feel her again there are we ?
a little bit , yeah .
pheebs is your grandmother maybe saying that you should live here alone ?
you heard her too ?
!
you have the gift !
phoebe , it s okay .
i like living with joey .
are you sure ?
oh please , i hate packing , it s closer to work , and we do have fun .
although , i m really going to miss living with you .
oh me too .
i know .
oh oh , wait did you hear that hear that ?
listen , i m gettin  something from your grandmother , she said that since you get to keep the one bedroom apartment you should give rachel the purple chair ?
no , i do not hear that .
and the miracle was that that little bit of oil that should ve just lasted just one day , burned for  that s right , and that s why we celebrate hanukkah today .
the end .
yeah ?
my favorite part was when superman flew all the jews out of egypt .
the armadillo was actually not so thrilled about that part !
okay ben , it s time to light the hanukkah candles !
hey !
oh .
wow !
it looks like the easter bunny s funeral in here .
come on , come on , we re we re we re lighting the candles !
oh .
oh .
okay , i understand why superman is here , but why is there a porcupine at the easter bunny s funeral ?
i got it !
is it back in the cage ?
its back in cage !
cage closed ?
joey , would you just come out here and stop being such a baby !
phoebe ?
yeah ?
look at that guy by the window , wow !
he s awfully short and i think he s talking to himself .
and to be completely honest , he s not that good in bed .
oh , what is wrong with me lately ?
i mean it s like every guy i see i mean look here .
look at that guy for example , i mean normally that s not someone i would would be attracted to , but right now , with the way i m feeling , all i want to do is rip off his sweatpants and fanny pack .
wait a second !
this is about the fourth month of your pregnancy , right ?
yeah .
this is completely normal , around the fourth month your hormones start going crazy .
really ?
!
so this has happened to you ?
oh absolutely yeah !
oh and keep in mind , now , i was carrying triplets so in , y know , medical terms i was i was thrice as randy .
wow !
this explains so much !
last weekend , i went from store to store sitting on santa s lap .
yeah .
yeah , i remember trying to steal a cardboard cutout of evander holyfield from a foot locker .
ah .
yeah .
well , y know what ?
i go see my doctor tomorrow , i ll ask her about this .
maybe she can give me a pill or something .
yeah .
yeah , that s what you need a good pill .
hi !

congratulations !

sending out a holiday card , together , i mean i just don t know if we re really quite there yet .

yeah , we re not just doing a card !
y know , she she also wants to have the conversation about where the relationship is going .
ugh !
women !
i know !
i know !
why do you guys need to have this conversation ?
!
huh ?
i mean no self respecting man would ask a woman , so , where is this going ?
uh ross ?
you asked me that .
hey !
you were a closed book !
okay ?
i m not a mind reader !
besides , i hate those conversations .
i m horrible at them .
really !
maybe maybe i need kind of a gesture .
y know , something that says we re moving forward without having to talk about it .
like asking her to move in with you ?
smaller than that .
making her a mixed tape ?
uh , bigger than that .
give her a key to your apartment .
whoa hello !
we were closer with the mixed tape .
all right .
have you said , i love you ?
you could say , i love you .
yeah i i don t i don t think i m quite there yet , but i could say i looove spending time with you .
no , we hate that .
that is a slap in the face .
forget it .
i i y know what ?
i ll just have the conversation .
i ll just say i like things the way they are , and hope for the best .
what do you think rach ?
i think , if it was a little colder in here i could see your nipples through that sweater .
oh uh , as it turns out , we can t do it .
monica has to work .
oh uh well tomorrow s no good for her either .
it s the semi finals of her botchy ball tournament .

aw , we we are so  so umm , well i i i like you and i i love umm , y know hanging out with you .
and i mean i m having a lot of fun .
i mean , there s no point in spending time with someone if if it s just fun .
it s got to be , it s got to be going somewhere right ?
so where where is it going ?
ah !
that s that s the real question .
and and the answer is is it s going somewhere fun .
now i i know what you re thinking , fun was fine for you like ten years ago y know , but you re you re not getting any younger .
no i mean no not you , not you , you you are getting younger .
i mean you you look like you re getting younger by the second what s your secret ?

.
.
ah , the forbidden love of a man and his door .
shh .
he did it .
he told her off , and not just about the kiss , about everything .
you are kidding .

those weren t albino kids , that was computer camp !
rach !
hey .
hey .
you re a pathetic loser , right ?
oh ho , yeah !
sit !
oh my gosh , joshua !
they re not true ?
oh .
oh !
oh , i love that but .
you want to go inside and have some coffee ?
okay .
every time .
oooh , what you got there ?
pastrami .
oh ho ho , yeah !
hey !
y know what goes good with that ?
hm mm , corn beef .
ooh , i was going to say bologna , but that s much better .
how about a little of that smoked turkey ?
okay .
oh mama !
uh when when is the baby due ?
six months .
ugh .
now if a cow should die of natural causes , i can have one of those right ?
not if i get there first .
morning , roomie !
hey !
you remembered to put clothes on this morning .
fifth day's a charm .
oh , joey , it is so great to be back here .
i got to tell you , you are making it so easy on me and emma .
hey , it is great having you back .
you know , stay as long as you want , and when does she stop crying all night ?
hey , you are not naked !
so hey , rach , when will we expect to see you tonight ?
well , I will probably be back to pick her up around six , but she is in the bedroom all ready to go .
but she did actually fall back to sleep , so .
.
.
she is probably exhausted from all that adorable screaming she did last night .
bye !
bye !
hey , i hope emma is not making it too hard on you .
no , hey , it is been great .
yeah ?
yeah .
and look , i just want you to know that with rachel staying here and everything , all my feelings from before are totally over , okay ?
and even if they were not , when you accidentally walk in on a woman using a breast pump .
.
.
yeah , that will do it .
wow !
so , how are you ?
I am , I am okay .
really ?
sure , i mean , do i wish me and rachel living together would have worked out ?
of course .
you know , I am disappointed , but it is not like it is a divorce .
well , actually it .
.
.
no , it is not a divorce , it is not a divorce !
anyway , i think rachel and i need to , you know , get on with our lives , maybe , maybe start seeing other people .
wow , really ?
yeah , sure , why not ?
in fact , if you know anyone that would be good for me .
.
.
sure , i know lots of girls .
yeah ?
any names come to mind ?
ooh , names ?
hey .
hey .
i was just going to get something to eat .
you want something ?
what you got ?
goodie !
thanks .
so , how is it living with rachel again ?
i mean , apart from the great food .
I am fine , I am fine , it is just , it is just weird what is happening with her and ross .
you know , yesterday he asked me to fix him up with somebody .
oh my god , rachel asked me if i knew anyone for her too .
why are they doing this ?
i do not know .
they are so perfect for each other ; it is crazy .
you know what is crazy ?
these jars .
what is it , like two bites in here ?
i just wish they would realise they should be together .
i know , i know .
and when they moved back in together , i figured y'know , that is where things were headed .
i know .
they should be a family .
they should get married and have more children .
yes , and they should name one of their kids joey .
i may not have kids ; someone is got to carry on the family name .
you know what ?
maybe once they start dating , and they see what is out there , they will realise how good they are for each other .
yeah , because it is slim pickings .
i had this date last night : yuck !
but we should probably keep it down ; she is still in the bedroom .
so , what are we going to do ?
are we just going to go ahead and set them up with people ?
i know ; that just pushes them further and further apart .
yeah .
oh , i know what we can do .
we could set ross and rachel up on horrible dates , so that they will realise how good they are together .
ooh , that is a great plan !
yeah , you know what the best part of it is ?
i get to do my plan laugh .
shhh !
not so loud , we do not want to wake up , uh .
.
.
hey !
hey !
you guys are not doing anything tonight , are you ?
see , now , why would you assume that ?
just because we are married ?
i will have you know that we are very hip , happening people .
now , if you will excuse me , i have to get back to reading the obituaries .
i was just asking because i need someone to watch emma tonight .
sure , we will do that .
what are you up to ?
well , phoebe set me up on a date .
oh my god .
wow .
why ?
what is the big deal ?
just figured , because you and ross are .
.
.
what , slept together a year and a half ago ?
yeah , I am all set .
well , i think it is great that you are going on a date , you know ?
i mean , it sounds healthy .
i mean , you have needs .
embrace your womanhood !
you want a job ?
turn off oprah ,  and send out a resume !
so I will bring her by around seven ?
is that okay ?
oh , it is perfect .
oh , you guys are going to have so much fun !
she is at such a cute age .
oh , a couple things .
now that she is eating solid food , she poops around the clock .
and watch out for your hair , because she likes to grab it .
and oh , she is also in this phase where if you leave the room , she screams bloody murder , but ah .
.
.
thanks , you guys .
have fun !
ooh , joey .
hey .
hey .
I am so excited ; i just set up rachel with the worst guy tonight .
all right !
who is he ?
well , it is this guy i used to massage .
and by massage , i mean hold down so he would not turn over and flash me .
oh , yeah .
she is this really boring woman .
she is a teacher !
a teacher ?
yeah , yeah , she is really into history and foreign movies .
.
.
and oh , oh , she loves puzzles .
huh ?
come on , who loves puzzles ?
well , ross does .
what .
.
.
you are    you are ruining the plan !
joey , you have    you have fixed him up with his perfect woman !
oh my god , you are right !
yeah .
she even reads for pleasure !
how do you even know a woman like that ?
what ?
I am not allowed to know smart women ?
joey .
i met her at the library .
i went in to pee .
so now what do we do ?
well , okay , I will    I will just call her and tell her the date's cancelled , and find him somebody else .
what if we do not find him somebody else ?
we will just tell her the date's off , but we do not tell ross , and he goes to the restaurant and gets stood up !
ooh .
i hear that is bad .
ooh , so this is great !
rachel's going to have a terrible date , ross gets stood up , and then they will realise how good they have it together .
ah , yes , the plan !
it is not santa's plan .
no , it is .
.
.
yeah , you know , it is not that fun .
no , i think we killed it .
emma ?
emma ?
look at me !
well , i think I will go downstairs for a while .
no , no , no , no !
no , no , no , no !
it is okay , it is okay .
i did not go .
do not cry , it is just a bit !
I am your uncle chandler ; funny is all i have !
okay , just so you know , I am going to be ovulating from tomorrow until the sixth , so do not touch yourself in the next 48 hours .
i do not do that .
I will try to stop .
wait , did you say until the sixth ?
yeah .
today is the sixth .
no , it is not .
yes , it is also 2003 .
oh my god .
today's the sixth ?
!
i may be done ovulating !
i may have also served some very questionable meat at the restaurant .
it is okay .
go take the test and see if we are okay .
okay .
tough crib .
hey , where are all my ovulation sticks ?
there is only one here .
i might have checked to see if i was ovulating a couple times .
chandler !
i am not working .
there is not much to do around here !
excuse me , is there a woman waiting at the bar ?
someone average height , dark hair , perhaps doing a puzzle ?
well , if I am still here in an hour , buy him a drink on me .
nah , i do not know if i should .
i do not want to be drunk when i go home alone .
yeah , it is no big deal .
it is just a blind date .
no !
we are okay .
I am still ovulating .
oh , good , because as of four of the clock this afternoon , i am not .
so , let us do this .
i    i do not think i can .
come on .
i know you are not eighteen anymore , but give it a minute .
because of emma .
oh my god , emma .
oh , sweetie , i forgot you were here .
oh , you are right , we can not do this .
we can not leave her alone .
sorry .
unless .
.
.
maybe we do it here .
i mean , how much can she even be aware of at this age ?
well , she is aware when we leave the room .
she may notice if we start .
.
.
canoodling in it .
canoodling ?
well , i can not say hump  or screw  in front of the b a b y .
i do not know .
i mean , i guess having sex in front of a baby is not so .
.
.
horrifying ?
scarring ?
something people go to jail for ?
i guess you are right .
you guess I am right ?
when we stayed at that bed and breakfast , you would not have sex with me because you thought a deer was staring through the window .
but what kind of a sick bastard wants to do it in front of a deer ?
wow , everything looks so good !
i think I am going to have the chicken .
oh , well , that is    that is very sweet .
thank you .
what ?
well , come on , steve ; let us not rule out nervous laughter .
hey , now wait a minute .
phoebe told me that    that you owned your own restaurant .
that is impressive .
really ?
what is that like ?
really ?
hello ?
phoebe , it is me .
I am going to hunt you down and kill you !
hey , rach !
this is the worst date ever .
how could you set me up with this creep ?
you know , you are talking about one of my dear , dear friends .
i do not care !
this guy is a nightmare !
oh , right , so he gets a little crazy when he is stoned .
he is not stoned .
did he go out for a cigarette ?
yeah , four times .
my dear , sweet rach .
oh , great , pretty soon they will be back together .
by the time anyone's figured out what we have done , we will be in sunny mexico .
oh , wait , that is the end of a different plan .
she is asleep .
chandler ?
what are you doing ?
emma was doing it !
she is asleep .
ooh , she is asleep , that means we can .
.
.
yes , but we have to be fast .
hello ?
emma ?
hey !
hi !
how are ya ?
how are ya ?
where are your babysitters , huh ?
why is the bedroom door closed ?
you can not have s e x , when you are taking care of the b a b i e !
eh , if it was meant to be , it is meant to be .
wow , free crab cakes .
well , that is nice .
although i was hoping to have sex tonight .
just the crab cakes .
what is    what is going on ?
what ?
you    you are making money off my misery ?
this is unbelievable .
i    i have never been so insulted in my life .
now , if you will wrap up my free crab cakes , I will be on my way .
well , that was weird .
you were loud , and i was fast .
i think we may have really done it this time .
oh , i wish i did not have to wait to take a pregnancy test .
you may want to get some more of those too .
where is emma ?
oh my god , where is emma ?
where is emma ?
do not ask me , i was in there canoodling you !
okay , okay , I am sure that rachel came home early and picked up emma .
you go look across the hall , and I will call her cell .
okay .
hey , you better hope that we are pregnant , because one way or another , we are giving a baby back to rachel .
no , no , no , i admire a man who can cry .
do not touch my coat !
oh , sorry , it is my phone .
hello ?
oh my god , this is the worst date ever !
hey , did you stop by here ?
no .
oh my god , then .
.
.
oh , thank god !
emma , there you are !
what ?
what do you mean , there you are  ?
where was she ?
oh , we were playing peek a boo .
she just   she loves it when I am dramatic .
because you two were having sex !
no , we were not !
do not you lie to me !
i could tell by chandler's hair .
you are so lazy .
can not you get on top for once ?
all right , all right , we were .
we were trying to make a baby .
monica's ovulating .
hey !
it is unacceptable that you two would have sex with emma in the next room .
I am going to have to tell rachel about this .
no , no , no .
no , please do not .
please , joey .
she will kill us !
hey , i got to !
unless .
.
.
unless what ?
unless you name your firstborn child joey .
what ?
why ?
hey , i may never have kids , and somebody is got to carry on my family name .
your family name is tribbiani .
you almost had me .
well , uh .
.
.
really , really not .
all right , well that is good to know .
good night , steve .
hey , what is wrong ?
i just had a rough night .
oh .
crab cake ?
eww !
well , what happened ?
oh , well , i .
it is kind of weird talking to you about this , but .
.
.
monica told me you had a blind date .
yeah .
i did , too .
oh .
but is it technically a date if the other person does not show up ?
oh , oh no .
do you think she walked in , saw you and left ?
why does everyone keep saying that ?
well , if it makes you feel any better , i wish my date had not shown up .
that bad ?
well , he makes t shirts for a living , and he thought it would be appropriate to give me this .
female body inspector ?
what size is that ?
now , wait a minute .
so , they are going to name their first child joey ?
uh huh .
how    how do i get them to name the next one after me ?
it is easy , you just walk in on them having sex .
oh , so they owe me like , three phoebes .
oh my god !
look , it is ross and rachel .
oh , the plan is working .
do not , do not do the plan laugh .
the first date we have had in months , and they were both such disasters .
oh .
huh .
you know , it is weird that phoebe would set me up on a date that was awful on the same night that joey set you up on a date that did not even show .
wait a minute ; you do not think it was intentional ?
i mean , that is just stupid .
we are geniuses !
yeah , look at them , look at them , they are really bonding .
oh , yeah , they are falling in love all over again .
oh , they see us !
oh , they , they look mad .
oh , they figured it out .
they are coming this way .
run !
where ?
mexico !
can you believe they are still not here ?
i know .
a double blind date , and we both get stood up .
what are the chances ?
i know , I am so bummed .
can we have our free crab cakes now ?
we have been stood up .
and we want our free crab cakes .
hi !
hi !
monica ?
what time is it ?
uhh , 9 .
but it is dark out .
well that is because you always sleep to noon , silly !
this is what 9 looks like .
i guess I will get washed up then .
watch that sunrise .
I am really getting tired of sneaking around .
i know , me too .
hey !
y'know what if we went away for a whole weekend ?
y'know we would have no interruptions and we could be naked the entire time .
all weekend ?
that is a whole lotta naked .
yeah , i can say that i have a conference and you can say you have a chef thing .
ohh , I have always wanted to go to this culinary fair that they have in jersey !
okay , y'know your not though .
let us go .
wait !
what about joey ?
hey , guess what I am doing this weekend !
I am going to this culinary fair in new jersey .
oh weird , chandler just told us he is got a conference there !
oh now that that that is funny , it seems like chandler's conference could have been in connecticut or vermont .
I am not in charge of where the conference is held .
do you want people to think it is a fake conference ?
it is a real conference .
hey .
hey !
hey .
is rachel here ?
i got to talk to her .
no , she is out shopping .
damn !
what is going on ?
i told emily to come .
and i just need to y'know , talk to rachel about it .
wait a minute !
so when emily comes you are just , you are not going to see rachel anymore ?
well look , I am just trying to focus on the i get to see my wife ,  part , all right ?
and not the part that makes me do this .
wow , so you guys are , you are never going to be in the same room together ?
how is that even going to work ?
i have no idea .
i mean  but but i assure you i will figure it out .
doesn t seem like it is going to work , i mean   hi , guys !
hi !
uh , hey !
what is going on ?
we are flipping monica's mattress .
so I am thinking , basically we pick it up and then we flip it .
yeah that is better than my way .
oh okay , hey guys , would you flip mine too ?
aww , man !
oh look !
a letter from my mom .
so , rach , y'know y'know how emily's coming right ?
oh yeah !
i know .
can you hear anything ?
oh yes , somebody just said , can you hear anything ?
hey , joey's ass !
what are you doing ?
well , remember when they got in that big fight and broke up and we were all stuck in her with no food or anything ?
well , when ross said rachel at the wedding , i figured it was going to happen again , so i hid this in here .
ooh , candy bars , crossword puzzles  ooh , madlibs , mine !
condoms ?
you do not know how long we are going to be in here !
we may have to repopulate the earth .
and condoms are the way to do that ?
anyway it it kind of it all boils down to this , the last time i talked to emily   oh my god !
my dog died !
what ?
!
oh my god , le poo , our dog !
le poo's still alive ?
!
oh god , it says he was hit by an ice cream truck and dragged for nine   teen blocks .
oh .
oh my god .
sweetie , we heard you crying .
please do not cry .
it is le poo .
i know it is le poo right now , but it will get better .
i can not believe it !
we are here !
ooh , chocolates on the pillows !
i love that !
oh , you should live with joey , roll os everywhere .
come here .
okay , be right back .
oh yes !
monica , get in here !
there is a high speed car chase on !
we are switching rooms .
oh dear god , they gave us glasses !
no , they gave us glasses with lipstick on them !
i mean , if they did not change the glasses , who knows what else they did not change .
come on sweetie , i just want this weekend to be perfect , i mean we can change rooms , can not we ?
okay , but let us do it now though , because chopper 5 just lost it is feed !
hey , so uh , y'know how there is something i wanted to talk to you about ?
oh yeah !
well , y'know how I am trying to work things out with emily .
well , there is this one thing  okay ,  here goes .
i made a promise that   oh hey !

okay ?
do we really want to spend the entire weekend like this ?
oh , I am sorry , am i getting in the way of all the room switching fun ?
hey , do not blame me for wigging tonight !
oh , who should i blame ?
the nice bell man who had to drag out luggage to 10 different rooms ?
i do not know , how about the idiot who thought he could drive from albany to canada on a half a tank of gas !
do not speak ill of the dead .
we are supposed to uh , be spending a romantic weekend together , it it , what is the matter with you ?
i just want to watch a little television .

hey .
rachel , i i I have been wanting to tell you something for a while now and i really , i just have to get it out .
okay , what is up ?
okay , y'know how you told me i should do whatever it takes to fix my marriage ?
yeah , i told you to give emily whatever she wants .
and while that was good advice , you should know that what what she wants  yeah ?
is for me not to see you anymore .
that is crazy !
you can not do that !
what are you going to tell her ?
oh god .
ohh , you already agreed to this , have not you ?
it is awful i know , i mean , i feel terrible but i have to do this if i want my marriage to work .
and i do , i have to make this marriage work .
i have too .
but the good thing is we can still see each other until she gets here .
ohh !
lucky me !
oh my god !
that is good news , ross !
i think that is the best news I have heard since le poo died !
you have no idea what a nightmare this has been .
this is so hard .
oh yeah , really ?
is it ross ?
yeah ?
okay , well let me make this a just a little bit easier for you .
what are you doing ?
storming out !
rachel , this is your apartment .
yeah , well that is how mad i am !
!
damn rollos !
hey , you are back !
hey .
how was your conference ?
it was terrible .
i fought with  my colleagues y'know , the entire time .

oh , so your weekend was a total bust ?
uh , no , i got to see donald trump waiting for an elevator .
hi !
hey , you are back too !
yeah .
umm , chandler can i talk to you outside for a second ?
hey , how was your chef thing ?
oh , it was awful .
i guess some people just do not appreciate really good food .
well , maybe it was the kind of food that tasted good at first but then made everybody vomit and have diarrhea .
chandler !
monica .
okay , I would like to know how much the room was because I would like to pay my half .
okay , fine , $300 .
300 dollars ?
!
yeah , just think of it as $25 per room !
urghh !
!
what are you guys woofing about ?
chandler stole a twenty from my purse !
nooooo !
!
!
y'know what ?
now that i think about it , i constantly find myself without twenties and you always have lots !
you should have seen the look on her face .
i do not want rachel to hate me !
i do not know what to do .
you want my advice ?
yes !
please !
you are not going to like it .
that is okay .
you got married to fast .
that is not advice !
i told ya .
I am going to the bathroom .
man , if anyone asked me to give up any of you , i could not do it .
maybe i could do it .
hi !
hi , rach .
hi !
hey .
hey .
look , i know you guys heard about the whole thing with me and ross but y'know , I have been obsessing about it all day and I would just love not to talk about it .
all right ?
i i i do not know if this falls under this category , but uh , ross is right back there .
that is not ross !
oh no !
not that guy !
he does look like him though .
okay , ross is in the bathroom .
oh my god , its happening .
it is already started .
I am kip .
hey , you are not kip !
do you even know who kip is ?
who cares ?
you are rachel !
who is kip ?
kip , my old roommate , y'know we all used to hang out together .
oh , that poor bastard .
see ?
yeah , you told me the story .
he and monica dated when they broke up they could not even be in the same room together and you all promised that you would stay his friend and what happened ?
he got phased out !
you are not going to be phased out !
well , of course i am !
it is not going to happen to ross !
he is your brother .
he is your old college roommate .
ugh , it was just a matter of time before someone had to leave the group .
i just always assumed phoebe would be the one to go .
ehh !
!
honey , come on !
you live far away !
you are not related .
you lift right out .
hey !
hey , mr .
bing .
that uh , hotel you stayed at called .
said someone left an eyelash curler in your room .
yes that was mine .
because i figured you would hooked up with some girl and she would left it there .
yes that would have made more sense .
y'know , i i do not even feel like i know you anymore man !
all right , look , I am just going to ask you this one time .
and whatever you say , I will believe ya .
were you , or were you not on a gay cruise ?
!
phoebe ?
I am sorry about the whole lifting out thing .
you got to come with me !
come where ?
wherever i go .
come on you and me , we will we will start a new group , we are the best ones .
okay , but try and get joey too .
pheebs , you mind if i speak to rachel alone for a sec ?
oh , sure !
bye ross !
forever .
hi .
hi .
what are you doing here ?
is not this against the rules ?
i talked to monica , look , I am the one who made the choice .
I am the one who is making things change , so i should be the one to y'know , step back .
oh , ross  no , no , it is okay .
really .
they are plenty of people who just see their sisters at thanksgiving and just see their college roommates at reunions and just see joey at burger king .
so is , is that better ?
no , it is not better .
i still do not get to see you .
well , what what would you do ?
rach , if you were me , what what would you do ?
well , for starters i would have said the right name at my wedding !
i can not believe this is happening .
i know .
i am so sorry .
i know that too .
hey , rach ?
sorry to interrupt but umm , phoebe wanted me to talk to you about a trip or something .
hey !
hi .
i just came over to drop off nothing .
so that weekend kind of sucked , huh ?
yeah , it did .
so , i guess this is over .
what ?
well , y'know , you and me , it had to end sometime .
why , exactly ?
because of the weekend , we had a fight .
chandler that is crazy !
if you give up every time you would have a fight with someone you would never be with anyone longer than ohhh !
so , this is not over ?
you are so cute !
no .
no , it was a fight .
you deal with it and move on !
it is nothing to freak out about .
really ?
okay .
great !
ohh , welcome to an adult relationship !
we are in a relationship ?
I am afraid so .
okay .
hey !
hey !

the most popular phoebe in tennis is called the overhand phoebe .
and if you win , you must slap your opponent on the phoebe and say , hi , phoebe !

i guess I am done .
fun's over !

hey !
hey .
hey , man .
what is up ?
maybe you can tell me .
my agent would like to know why i did not show up at the audition i did not know i had today .
the first good thing she gets me in weeks .
how could you not give me the message ?
!
well , I will tell ya i do enjoy guilt , but , ah , it was not me .
yes , it was !
it was him !
uh huh !
okay , it was me !
how is it you ?
well , it was just , it was all so crazy , you know .
i mean , chandler was in the closet , counting to 10 , and he was up to 7 and i had not found a place to hide yet .
i i i meant to tell you , and i wrote it all down on my hand .
see , all of it .
yep , that is my audition .
see , now this is why i keep notepads everywhere .
yep , and that is why we do not invite you to play .
well , estelle tried , you know .
the casting director told her that i missed my chance .
that is unfair .
I will call her and tell her it was totally my fault .
pheebs , you can not do that .
the casting director does not talk to friends , she only talks to agents .
what a sad little life she must lead .
okay , ooh  .
what , what are you doing ?
what are you doing ?
no , no , no , i know , i know , ooh .
'hi , this is katelynn , from phoebe buffay's office .
um , is um , ann there for phoebe , she will know what it is about . '
hang up , hang up .
'annie !
hi .
listen we got a problem with joey tribbiani , apparently he missed his audition .
who did you speak to in my office ?
estelle , no , i do not know what I am going to do with her .
no .
all right , so your husband leaves and burns down the apartment , the world does not stop . '
is anybody else scared ?
'right , well look , um , if joey loses this audition , that is it for estelle .
i do not care !
annie you are a doll , what time can you see him ? '
i need a pen .
get the woman a pad !
get the woman a pad !
a pad !
a pad !
oh , now you want a pad .
there is my boy !
here is my boy !
and here is his barbi  what is ah , what is my boy doing with a barbi ?
yeah , it is , it is , it is cute .
why , why , why does he have it , again ?
you know what it is fine .
if you are okay with the barbi thing , so am i .
give daddy the barbi !
ben , give , give me the barbi .
okay , how 'bout , do not you want to play with the monster truck ?
no .
okay , oh , oh , how about a dino soilder ?
ross , you are so pathetic .
why can not your son just play with his doll ?
i got to go to work .
has anybody seen my left boob ?
i love that movie .
there it is .
joey , what are you doing ?
I am sorry , it just felt nice .
joe .
joe !
answer the phone .
hey , i only got one good arm , you know .
you should be doing stuff for me .
go get me a sweater .
just do it !
okay , it is janice and if i get it I am going to have to see her tonight .
oh , that is great I am going to have to see her tonight .
what is the big deal ?
why do not you want to see janice ?
okay , last night at dinner , when the meals came , she put half her chicken piccata on my plate and took my tomatoes .
and that is bad because .
.
.
, you hate chicken piccata ?
noo .
you did not want to share your tomatoes , tomatoes are very important to you .
no , it is like all of the sudden , we were this couple .
and this alarm started going off in my head : 'run for your life !
get out of the building ! '
men are unbelievable .
what is it with you people !
i mean , the minute you start to feel something , you have to run away ?
i know , that ,  that is why i do not want to go tonight , I am afraid I am going to say something stupid .
oh , you mean like that guy thing where you act mean and distant until you get us to break up with you .
hey , you know about that ?
!
look what do i do ?
i want to get past this , i do not want to be afraid of the commitment thing .
i want to go through the tunnel , to the other side !
where there is no fear of commitment .
do we have any .
.
.
do we have any thoughts here ?
well , I have never been through the tunnel myself , because as i understand it , you are not allowed to go through with more than one girl in the car , right .
but , it seems to me it is pretty much like anything else , you know , face your fear .
it have a fear of heights , you go to the top of the building !
if you are afraid of bugs .
.
.
get a bug .
right .
in this case , you have a fear of commitment , so i say you go in there and be the most committed guy there ever was .
amazingly , that makes sense .
you think ?
oh , yeah .
go for it man , jump off the high dive , stare down the barrel of the gun , pee into the wind !
yeah , joe , i assure you if I am staring down the barrel of a gun , I am pretty much peeing every which way .
oh , it is your audition from this morning .
can i use the phone again ?
sure pheebs , you know , that is what it is there for , emergencies and pretend agents .
come on baby , come on !
'hi , i have phoebe buffay returning a page .
okay , well , um , she is in her car I will have to patch you through . '
very nice touch .
'okay , go ahead . '
um , hi annie .
fantastic !
you got it .
oh , okay , um , 'will he work for scale ? '
you ask me .
well , i do not know about that ,  except that i do and he will .
great , oh you are such a sweetheart .
i would love to have lunch with you , how about we have lunch next .
.
.
.
op , went through a tunnel .
unbelievable .
thank you so much .
it was really fun , i mean I have never talked on a car phone before .
you were amazing , could you just do me this huge favor , you see there is this one other audition that i really , really want , and estelle could not get me in .
oh , i do not know .
i mean it was fun one time .
come on , please , it will be just this one more , well actually it is two .
two ?
yeah !
well , well really it is three .
please .
you are so good at it .
i love you .
okay , I will do it , but just these three , right nooo , four .
because , i wanted to uh , give you this .
well , wait there is , there is more .
see the contact paper is to go into your brand new drawer .
see , the drawer actually goes in my dresser .
yes , i did .
yes , i did .
because , you are my girlfriend , and that is what girlfriends should , should get .
well , not me .
but that is what is happened , and , ah , and , and there is more .
we should take a trip .
yep , we are a couple and that is what couples do .
and , i want to meet your parents .
we should take a trip with your parents !
i am , i actually am .
i mean this is amazing .
my entire life i have feared this place , and now that I am here it is like what was the big deal .
i could probably say 'let us move in together . '
and I would be okay .
it does not scare me !
oh , no , no , no , do not go !
I have scared ya ' !
I have said too much !
I am hopeless , and awkward , and desperate for love !
!
hey , janice !
it is me .
um , yeah , i i i just want to apologize in advance for having chased you down the street .
honey , this will help .
so , i finally catch up to her and she says this relationship is going to fast and we have to slow down .
that is never good .
then i got all needy and clingy .
okay , wait a minute , wait a minute , wait a minute .
maybe it is not so bad .
how did you leave it ?
she said she would call me .
oh god .
welcome to our side of the tunnel .
this ice cream tastes like crap by the way .
yeah , well that is that lo cal , non dairy , soy milk junk .
we sort of , we save the real stuff for those really terminal cases .
you know , when you start get screwed over all the time , you got to switch to low fat .
yeah , you do .
so , you do not think I am terminal ?
well , no , not at all , you are not terminal , you just , you just need some damage control .
okay , okay .
so , should i call her ?
this is a very critical time right now .
if you feel yourself reaching for that phone , then you go shoe shopping , you get your butt in a bubble bath .
you want her back you have to start acting aloof .
she has to know that your not ready .
right .
so , what you have to do is , you have to accidentally run into her on purpose .
and then act aloof .
so I am not , not going to lose her ?
oooh , honey , you are not a total loser .
i said , 'so I am not going to lose her ? '
oh .
guess who is here .
it is the toughest guy in toy land , ben .
'a real american hero .
I am g.i .
joe ! '
drop the barbi , drop the barbi .
g.i .
joe ?
do you really think he is going to fall for that ?
g .
i .
joe !
cool !
can i play ?
look ben , it is a toy that protects you.s .
oil interests overseas !
helloo !
oh !

phoebe .
phoebe !
oh , joey !
oh , okay , see i did not recognize you wearing , in those .
.

look listen , that tv movie i went in for ?
did you hear anything ?
i think i got a shot at it .
yes !
they called and you did not get it !
okay , i mean you did not get it , I am sorry , I am sorry .
it is okay , these things happen .
but they should not happen , you know what , you are , you are in a terrible , terrible business .
oh god , i do not want to be the person who makes your face look like that .
I am , I am okay .
see .
oh , now you are sad and creepy , oh .
you know what , i , I am sorry i quit , okay , i just quit .
no !
no , no you can not quit !
you are the best agent i ever had !
look pheebs , rejection is part being an actor , you can not take it personally .
not personal , really , well they said that they never met an italian actor with a worse italian accent .
they actually said that ?
yeah .
ooh god , there is that face again !
see i can not do this job !
i .
.
.
no , no , no , see that is why you have to do this job , agents always lie .
you know , estelle just says stuff like 'they went another way ' , but this , i can use this .
i canna work on a new accent .
yeah okay , no if it helps you okay .
yeah .
you will never get me , joe !
!
!
hello , janice .
oh , just a bit of shopping .
how've you been ?
no .
not anymore .
yeah , huh .
I am just uh , you know I am just picking up some things for a party .
well , I am sorry if my friends are not as sophisticated as yours .
here in chelsea .
a woman's  chelsea .
can i be that guy ?
okay , so we got some more good rejections , lots of stuff to work on .
okay , shoot .
okay , um , oh , the zoo commercial .
i did not get it ?
no .
they said you 'were not believable as a human being . '
so , you can work on that .
okay , what else ?
um , the off broadway play people said 'you were pretty but dumb . '
oh .
oh no wait , I am sorry , that is 'pretty dumb . '
look , it is okay , no , no , no , really , look um , i really appreciate this pheebs , but i think I am going to have to go back to estelle .
oh .
yeah , well do not get me wrong , you are a better agent than she is , but at least with her i do not want to blow my pretty dumb brains out .
yeah , no , i understand .
you do , thanks .
yeah .
sorry .
wait a minute .
what ?
wait a minute , did you just make up all that stuff just to get out of being my agent .
oh , you caught me .
i am so busted .
that is ah what i suspected ah .
.
.
and then i just , you know , threw the bag of barley at her , and ran out of the store .
my god !
chandler , we said be 'aloof ' not 'a doof ' .
I have actually ruined this have not i ?
it is time for the good ice cream now , right ?

be sleepy .
yes , and grumpy .

stupid , and , and scared , and .
.
stupid a couple of more times .
I am sorry .
really ?
!
really ?
!
he is soo lucky , if janice were a guy , she would be sleeping with somebody else by now .
i love you too .
aw , it is soo unfair .
hey , i do not know what to tell you guys that is the doll he chose .
look , g .
i .
joe's in , barbi's out .
and if you guys can not deal with it , that is your 'too bad . '
what are you being such a weenie for ?
so he has a barbi , big deal .
you used to dress up like a woman .
what ?
well , you used to dress up in mom's clothes all the time .

how can you not remember ?
you made us call you .

i ve got a good one .
no thanks , i have a good one too .
i just , i , i can t see him .

that is so weird , because every time i go to the dentist , i look down the hygienist s blouse .
phoebe , what ?
umm .
what ?
!
yeah , yeah , first there was my aunt mary , and then there was umm , john , my mailman , and then my , my cowboy friend  albino bob  .
and all these people actually died ?
yes , while i was in the chair !
that s why i take such good care of my teeth now , y'know , it s not about oral hygiene , i floss to save lives !
pheebs , come on , you didn t kill anybody , these people just happened to die when you went to the dentist .
it s , it s , it s just ah , a coincidence .

joey , you can t keep this to yourself , if you know about this , you have to tell him .
it ll kill him .
i mean it ll , it ll just kill him .
well , you could wait  til i go to the dentist , maybe i ll kill him .

well , he s finally alseep .
about that ah , bump on his head ?

just the one divorce in '99 !
y'know what , i am going to be happy this year .
i am going to make myself happy .
do you want us to leave the room , or ?
everyday i am going to do one thing that i have not done before .
that my friends is my new year's resolution .
ooh !
that is a good one !
mine is to pilot a commercial jet .
that is good one too , pheebs .
now all you have to do is find a planeload of people who is resolution is to plummet to their deaths .
maybe your resolution is to not make fun of your friends , especially the ones who may soon be flying you to europe for free on their own plane .
she has a better chance of sprouting wings and flying up your nose than you do of not making fun of us .
in fact , I will bet you 50 bucks that you can not go the whole year without making fun of us .
eh , y'know what , better yet ?
a week .
I will take that bet my friend .
and you know what , paying me the 50 bucks could be the new thing you do that day !
and it starts right now !
all right , my new year's resolution is to learn how to play the guitar .
ohh .
really ?
!
how come ?
well , y'know those special skills i have listed on my resume ?
i would love it would be great if one of those was true .
do you want me to teach you ?
I am a great teacher .
really ?
who who have you taught ?
well , i taught me and i love me .
yeah that would be great !
thanks pheebs !
op , look !
claire forgot her glasses !
and she is going to be really needing these to keep an eye on that boyfriend , who , i hear , needs to keep his stapler in his desk drawer , if you know what I am talking about .
hey rach , maybe your resolution should be to umm , gossip less .
i do not gossip !
well , maybe sometimes i find out things or i hear something and i pass that information on y'know kind of like a public service , it does not mean I am a gossip .
i mean , would you call ted kopel a gossip ?
well if ted kopel talked about his coworkers botched boob jobs , i would .
what ?
they were like this !
okay !
hey !
i just asked that girl out .
nice !

how desperate am i ?
oh !
good thing chandler s not here , he always wins at this game .
i just told my mom i d cater a party for her .
how come ?
because i need the money , and i thought that it d be a great way to get rid of that last little schmidgen of self respect .
come on , i think this is a good thing .
i don t think mom would ve hired you if she didn t think you were good at what you do .
you don t have to stick up for her .
she can t here you .
hey !
umm , do you guys have any juice ?
just pickle .
hey uh , rach , funny story .
i ah , bumped into joanna on the street yesterday .
my boss , joanna ?
wow , that must ve been awkward .
well , no , actually she uh , asked me if i wanted to get a drink .
you ah , you didn t say  yes  to that did you ?
no .
no !
well , not at first .
what is she doing here ?
i don t understand !
last time you went out with her you said she was a  big , dull dud .
well , i think i judged her too quickly , and this time we were able to take the relationship to the next level .
well , last time i almost got fired .
you must end it , you must end it now !
oh , come on !
it s not like this is an everyday occurrence for me !
i mean usually i m pretty much just in there by myself .
chandler !
!
promise me , you will end it .
okay , i promise , i ll end it .
thank you .
i hope you know what i m giving up for ya , because she s not just the boss in your office , if you know what i mean .
yeah eh eah !
oh oh , sorry , i i knew what he meant .
doing great , the quiches are coming along .
yeah , i thought it was cute .
let me ask you a question .
why did you hire me ?
oh my god !
did you hear that ?
she hired me because she thinks i m good .
okay , i didn t hear that .
oh yeah , she didn t hire me out of pity , it wasn t so she could pick on me in front of her friends , she actually thinks i m good .
wow !
and hey , it s cool if you re a lesbian !
uhhhh .
no !
no .
but ah , try the classifieds , people sell everything in there .
i m telling you it s totally unconstituional .
i think he deserves a nobel prize .
it was like the algonquin kids table .
yeah well yeah !
yeah oh yeah .
come on in .
that s weird .
what ?
your nails .
oh , i know , i never wear fake ones .
i just did it so my mom wouldn t give me grief about me biting them .
oh , no , i meant that it s weird that you only have nine now .
oh my god .
wait a minute , i had them put   oh my god !
it s in the quiche !
oh my god !
okay , don t panic .
i m going to go to the store , i m going to get you another set of nails , no one s going to know , and you re going to look great .
oh !
oh , it s  because they re going to eat that s the problem .
okay ah , please don t freak out .
umm , but ah , there s a blue fingernail in one of the quiche cups , and there s no way to know which one .
and !
whoever finds it wins the prize !
then why are you laughing ?
what ?
you bet i d lose a nail ?
frozen lasagnas ?
you bet that i d screw up ?
!
so all that stuff about hiring me because i was good was  you promised dr .
weinburg , you d never use that phrase .
that s right .
my mom doesn t have any faith in me !
oh , that s hilarious !
ha ha ha ha ha .
i don t get it .
no !
you have lasagnas !
op , the ruined quiches are ready .
it just doesn t feel like we re breaking up .
okay .
thanks .
okay .
i m getting dressed .
when i walk outside naked people throw garbage at me .
what is it ?
ah ha , you re not the boss of me .
yeah , you are !
ooh , saucy .
you are , you re going to leave me like this ?
okay .
but if you don t come back soon ,  there s pretty much nothing i can do about it !
that s weird , she locked the door .
okay , swear you won t tell , but when mark left he gave me a key to joanna s office .
do you want to see the list ?
hi !
how are you ?
hello , joanna s office .
how little ?
!
look , this isn t funny !
you get back here right now !
why not ?
!
what ?
!
what ?
!
rachel , could i see you for a moment ?
okay , here s the situation .
the keys to the cuffs are on the back of the door .
could you be a doll and grab them and scoot on over and unlock me ?
and on a totally different subject , that is a lovely pantsuit .
you promised you would break up with her !
i did break up with her !
she just took it really , really well !
and the fact that you were jeopardising my career never entered your mind ?
!
it did enter my mind !
but then something happened that made it , shoot right out .
y'know what chandler , you got yourself into those cuffs , you get yourself out of them .
no no no no no no no !
!
i can t get myself right out of them !
you must have me confused with the amazing chandler !
!
come on , you have to unlock me , she could be gone for hours , and i m cold , and  oh , chandler !
!
all right , this is it !
you never see joanna again !
never !
you never come into this office again !
fine !
you give me back my walkman !
i never borrowed your walkman .
well , then i lost it .
you buy me one !
you got it !
here we go !
come on !
this is great !
ahhh !
does it hurt ?
no , i just always see guys doing this when they get handcuffs taken off them .
hello sweet pants !
wait a minute !
what are you going to tell joanna ?
about what ?
when she sees that you re gone , she s going to know that i let you out , and that i was in here , and i m going to get fired !
i ll make something up !
i m good at lying , i actually did borrow your walkman !
no , there s nothing to make up , she s going to know that i have a key to her office , i ve got to get you locked up back the way you were !
oh ho ho , i don t think so !
well , this is much better .
he cut off his ear .
i m out .
wow !
that s pretty nice .
i thought he cut off his ear  because he sucked .
what else you got in there ?
in the woods .
no wait wait , that s the joke answer .
spock s birth control .
hey !
hi .
this used to be your room ?
wow !
you must ve been in really good shape as a kid .
ohh , i m such an idiot .
i can t believe i actually thought she could change .
well , who cares what your mom thinks ?
so you pulled a monica .
oh good , i m glad that s catching on .
no but , why does that have to be a bad thing .
just change what it means .
y'know ?
go down there and prove your mother wrong .
finish the job you were hired to do , and we ll call that pulling a monica .
what ?
okay , umm , if a kid gets straight a s , his parents would say , yeah , he pulled a monica .
y'know ?
or a fireman saves a baby , and they go , yeah i know , he pulled a monica .
or someone hits a homerun and the announcer says , yeah , that one s outta here .
though some things don t change .
all right , i ll go down there .
but , i m not going to serve the lasagna .
i m going to serve something i make .
wow !
my breasts are really strong .
chandler !
chandler , please , i have to get you locked up back the way you were , i am sooo going to lose my job , she s very private about her office .
now i know why .
hey , look , you re in trouble either way !
okay ?
if she comes back and sees me locked to this instead of the chair , she s going to know you were in here .
so you might as well just let me go .
what if i clean your bathroom for a month ?
it still wouldn t be clean .
all i want is my freedom .
foot rubs for a month !
freedom !
i ll take all of your photos and put them into photo albums !

well ?
they re not even touching the lasagna !
really ?
!
oh , they love your casserole .
yes !

which would make you  well , i was going for wrong , but we can use your word .
wow !

please tell us what it is .
unagi is a state of total awareness .
okay ?
only by achieving true unagi can you be prepared for any danger that may befall you !
you mean in case someone is trying to steal your bamboo sleeping mat or your kettle of fish ?
all i m saying is , it s one thing being prepared for an attack against like each other ; whole another story being prepared for an attack , i don t know , like a  surprise !
!
all right , you know that one was coming , but that doesn t mean you have unagi .
ooh !
y know what ?
if we made reservations , we could have unagi in about a half hour .

i m telling ya , you re going to be dancing at my wedding before you re dancing at there s .

ugh .
i feel blue .
ohh , sweetie !
hey , i bet you anything that he s going to call you again .
yeah , maybe , but i don t think i even care .
i don t think he s the one i m sad about .
y know , i know that i said that i am totally okay with ross getting married , but as it turns out , i don t think i m handling it all that well .
yeah , maybe .
and i i am just trying to figure out why .
any luck ?
well , yeah , y know how ross and i were on again , off again , on again , off again ?
i guess i just figured that somewhere down the road , we would be on again .
again .
y know what ?
i think we all did .

hey !
so , i got us some reservations for sunday night , okay ?
how about , ernie s at 9 of clock ?

when ?
!
after the birth of our first secret child ?
!
ross didn t get the annulment ; we are still married .
what ?
you re kidding !
oh my god !
!
ross !
okay , maybe it wasn t my best decision .
but i just couldn t face another failed marriage .
okay , let me just jump in and ask , at what point did you think this was a successful marriage ?
rach , come on , if you think about it , it s actually kind of funny .
okay , maybe it s best not to think about it .
okay , this is inexcusable .
i am shocked to my very core !
phoebe , i told her you already knew .
another lie .
you have a sickness !
ross , just for my own piece of mind , you re not married to anymore of us are ya ?
oh !
hey , somebody left their keys .
ooohh , to a porsche !
{transcriber s note : oh come on !
who would leave the keys to their porsche behind ?
if i had a porsche , i d have the keys surgically attached to my hand ! }
hey gunther , these yours ?
na uh !
hey did anybody lose their keys ?
joey , why don t you put them in the lost and found ?
there s a lost and found ?
my shoe !
you left a shoe here ?
!
well , i didn t realize until i got home .
i wasn t going to walk all the way back down here with one shoe !
y know what ?
i m going to go find that guy s car and leave a note on the windshield .
oh good , when he comes back for his keys , i ll be sure to give him your shoe .
great !
thanks .
oh , good , good , you guys are here !
listen , how would like to spend tomorrow taking care of three incredibly cute little puppies ?
!
oh my god , what a fun day !
that sounds great !
yeah , all right .
okay , well i ll bring them by tomorrow morning .
okay , and uh , by the way , they re not actually puppies , they re frank and alice s triplets .
okay , see ya !
whoa whoa whoa !
what ?
please !
please !
please !
please !
oh please !
please !
please !
frank and alice asked me to baby sit the triplets and i m nervous  because i ve never done that before by myself !
don t worry about it phoebe , we ll absolutely do it .
yeah , i m going to pass .
because i was kind of iffy when it was puppies .
come on chandler , come on !
it ll give us great practice for when people with babies come to visit .
yeah , it s not mine .
yeah , it s  mine .
me too !
yeah .
and comfortable .
do uh , do you like leather seats ?
it s got  them !
so , i still have boxes here .
i still have boxes at ross s , and i have nowhere to live !
wow .
i could so easily freak out right now .
what about me ?
i just found out that denise is leaving town for a while , i don t have a roommate .
well , maybe maybe i could be your roommate pheebs .
maybe you could be my roommate !
well there s an idea !
!
yeah !
that would be great !
wait , how long is denise gone for ?
umm , she said she d be back december 26th .
december 26th , huh maybe she s santa clause .
oh look who it is , my husband .
the apple of my eye .
okay , i got us a court date for tomorrow at 2:00 and i picked up all the forms .
i ll take care of everything .
well sure , if you say you re going to take care of everything i have no reason to doubt you .
give me those forms !
all right , now i m going to do this my way and i don t want to hear a peep out of you !
okay rach , but  op !
you re peeping !
ross !
y know what , i just got why ?
why did you do this ?
!
look i told you  i don t want to hear three failed marriages !
look , if you d had two failed marriages , you d understand !
well , y know what ?
thanks to you i m half way there !
ugh !
oh !
i am so mad !
ross , i don t think i have ever been this angry !
what about the time i said we were on a break ?
ugh !
pheebs , how s it going ?
i m doing okay .
i think it s going well .
do you think they re having fun ?
am i talking to fast ?
nope , sound like me .
pheebs , it s going great .
look at chandler with little baby girl chandler .
little baby girl chandler , where i have heard that before ?
oh right , coach ruben .
do you know what pheebs ?
when you re done over there , we kind of have a situation over here too .
na uh , no , we are all responsible for our own babies .
see that s where i think that you re wrong .
we ve been playing these babies man for man ; we should really be playing a zone defense .
what do you mean ?
i just think that things would go a lot smoother if we each have our own zone .
phoebe , you can be in charge of wiping .
and y know mon , you can be in charge of diapering and i can be in charge of looking how cute they are when they put their hands around   that sounds really great , but maybe you should be in charge of wiping .
okay , i m a rookie .
i should not be in the end zone .
this is so great !
this is exactly how we set the plates at the restaurant .
yeah ?
well this is not what i ordered .
hey guys !
hey !
hey !
hey babies !
oh , i m having the best morning .
that uh , that porsche i ve got the keys too , still there !
shocking !
since you still have the keys .
you should see the treatment i get when i m with that car !
people are friendly ; they they want to talk , and not just about the car !
one guy gave me advice about my equity investments .
what equity investments ?
the ones that got me the porsche !
will you keep up !
but i figured , if if people keep seeing me just standing there , they re going to start to think that i don t own it .
so i figured i ll wash it .
right ?
monica , you got a bucket and some soap i can borrow ?
oh yeah , i got soap and sponges and rags and carnuba wax and polishing compound .
you don t even have a car !
i know .
but umm , one time there was this really dirty car in front of the building , so i washed it .
and ?
and six others .
there you are .
yeah , she tops out at 130 .
and that s just in the city .
i get her up to 160 when i take her upstate .
sure !
okay , take it easy .
really ?
oh uh , oh just give me five more minutes with it .
oh i i uh , found the keys and now i m just polishing her up .
yeah , but it s my wax .
sure .
here .
i ll uh , save your parking spot .
why not ?
yeah , so did i .
i don t know why i was so nervous about this .
and i don t know why frank and alice are always complaining .
this is so easy .
yeah , two hours , a lifetime that s the same .
check it out !
check it out !
when the babies wake up , they can meet krog !
chandler , what are you doing ?
that thing can put someone s eye out !
he can do more than that !
he can destroy the universe !
no chandler , they can swallow one of those little parts !
and also , look at his smooth area , that s just going to mess them up .
they re not going to swallow anything , you guys are being way over protective .
when i was a kid , my mom used to just throw me into a pile of broken glass !
what ?
!
glass , sand , whatever .
oh , look at little leslie stretching in her sleep .
oh it s so cute .
i wonder what age it is when you stop being able to put both legs over your head .
oh , i can still do that .
how are you still single ?
!
all right .
i thought about it and maybe you re right .
maybe krog is not a safe toy .
good .
what made you change your mind ?
i swallowed the sonic blaster gun .
how did that happen ?
!
!
well , i was trying to prove that i was right .
y know ?
and it turns out i was wrong .
and now it s lodged in my throat .
damnit !
y know this whole time we were concentrating on watching the babies and , and no one was watching chandler !
yes your honor , and here are , are forms , all filled out .
fine , i m mentally unstable .
what ?
!
uh yes , heroin and crack .
crack isn t even an intravenous drug !
well , you would know .
oh , come on !
ross , please , i found the magazines !
okay , i m sorry , this is insane !
i i i m not addicted to heroin , i m not gay , and there is no problem with my ability to consummate anything !
look , i ll consummate this marriage right here , right now !
and when we were dating we consummated like bunnies !
ugh !
ross !
your honor , rest assured relationship ended like two years ago !
and could you strike consummated like bunnies  from the record ?
well , yes , we got married in vegas and uh , and the names i think .
that s great !
are you happy now ?
look what you did with your funny , funny form !
what ?
!
me ?
!
what about you and your consummated like bunnies nonsense !
and what what are you typing that for ?
did you hear what she said ?
we don t get the annulment .
don t type that !
what ?
!
stop typing !
hey !
stop typing !
stop typing !
stop typing !
!
okay , do you see , do you see what you re keeping me married too ?
!
all right look lady here is the deal , i came here for an annulment and i am not leaving here until i get one !
yeah !
and thank you for your time .
so the porsche guy took his car back .
but you found the keys to his clothes ?
no .
no , i just uh , i just loved the way it feels when everybody thinks i own a porsche .
and people will think you own a porsche because you re wearing the clothes ?
of course !
only an idiot would wear this stuff if you didn t have the car !
right ?
that is true .
yeah , but only a genius would swallow a sonic blaster gun .
oh , i ve been there .
yeah , i am going to go drive my porsche .
joey , you know you don t actually have one .
come on !
what are you doing ?
!
i m in character !
would you talk to her !
ahh , i think it just moved .
it s really poking me .
all right , that s it , we re going to the emergency room .
what ?
!
no , you can t , you can t leave me here with them !
we re baby sitting !
the babies are asleep , i m sure you ll be okay on your own for a while !
but you you can t leave me with them !
we we re a team !
we re playing a zone !
they re going to triple team me !
he s got something plastic lodged in his throat , we ve got to go to the hospital .
but no , because a doctor won t be able to help him , it s just going to y know naturally pass through his system in like seven years .
i think that s gum .
i m pretty sure it s gun .
okay , listen this really hurts .
let s go .
a real man wouldn t just run to the hospital !
no !
what would , what would krog do ?
why isn t that valet back with my porsche ?
porsche .
this is totally your fault !
my fault ?
!
you threatened the judge !
well , you ripped the paper out of the court reporter s machine !
!
that was the only way i could get him to stop typing !
hi !
how are the gellers ?
don t call us that !
the judge wouldn t let us get an annulment !
now we got to get a divorce !
!
did a porsch throw up on you ?
hey !
it s porsche !
!
me taking care of you is no problem , huh ?
you guys feel safe .
right ?
okay , i m going to take that spit bubble as , yeah , i do !
okay , after i get rid of this dirty diaper leslie , i ll set you up with a clean one .
okay , i m sorry .
i didn t mean to scare you .
i just have to clean that up .
okay ?
because let s face it , we re at monica s .
i broke it .
all right .
well , that s just the way that goes .
okay , good .
why are there only two of you ?
where is leslie ?
well , you can t answer .
leslie ?
where are you leslie ?
leslie , now would be a good time for your first words !
well , look at you !
hey !
you are a little bit mischievous !
my gosh !
oh , you re a lot mischievous !
well , it ll dry .
okay , you sit with your brother and sister now who aren t there !
hey !
how do you feel ?
well , let s just say that krog will be fully equipped to destroy the universe again in twelve to fourteen hours .
okay , so i totally took care of the babies all by myself !
i fed  them , bathed  them , and put  them to bed .
and protected them from a tornado ?
oh my god .
i know , the babies are asleep .
phoebe , what , what happened here ?
!
i did it !
i took care of the babies all by myself !
but my apartment !
was the setting of phoebe s triumph .
but the mess !
is not as important as the fact that phoebe took care of the babies all by herself .
you re right , you re right i shouldn t freak out .
because this is what will happen when you and i have babies !
when will that be ?
!
phoebe , would you take a look at this mess !
!
!
!
oh honey thank god you re home , i was getting worried .
i picked up the divorce papers .
uh , i ve already signed everything and i put little  x s where you need to sign .
oh , little  x s !
great !
that makes up for everything !
y know , i i you ve done a lot of stupid stuff too !
okay ?
oh , name one stupid thing that is as stupid as this one !
okay , how about you flew to london to stop my wedding !
ah , how about you told me you loved me after i was already married !
hey !
wait a minute !
that was different !
i did those things because i was in love with you !
yeah !
right !
you re right .
that s very different .
so let s , let s just sign the papers .
all right ?
what ?
nothing .
okay , can we just sign please ?
uh hmm .
congratulations .
okay ross , we re wait a minute .
umm , i uh , i kind of have a little confession .
what ?
well , y know this whole marriage thing , kind of my idea .
excuse me ?
well , remember how we were too drunk to remember anything the night we were married ?
yeah ?
and uh , yeah , i didn t really , i didn t want to say anything , but it kind of it just , it kind of kept coming back to me , and umm , remember we were in the casino and for some reason thought it would be funny to eat a lot of grapes .
and uh , and i thought it would be funnier if we got married .
so as a , as a compromise we decided first to get married , and then  to eat a lot of grapes .
so umm , sorry i got us into this mess .
so then if if i mean if you think about it , this is all  your fault .
yeah , don t push it though .
i ve got to say ; i know i divorce a lot of women , never thought i would be divorcing you .
i know .
i always thought if you and i got married , it would be the one that stuck .
and it wouldn t be a secret , and we wouldn t have our wedding dinner at pizza hut .
did i , did i even treat ?
no , it was on the house , it was , it was a newlywed special .
that may be the most depressing thing i ve heard in my life .
i should probably get these to my lawyer s office .
hey , thanks ross , for taking care of all of this .
eh , no problem .
i m going to need a copy of those .
totally .
hey !
hey !
be careful around my porsche !
hey !
how you doin  ?
i d love to show ya , but i just tucked her in .
she s sleeping .
hey uh , would you two girls like to go for a drink ?
you are welcome for a delicious dinner .
hey what are you guys looking at ?
ross and the most beautiful girl in the world .
yeah , come to papa .
i know !
probably the only time I will ever say this , but did you see the ass on her ?
where did you , when did you , how did you .
.
.
how did you get a girl like that ?
yeah , so what is she , like a .
.
.
like a spokesmodel , or an aerobics instructor , what ?
actually she is a paleontology doctoral candidate , specializing in the centazoic era .
okay , but that is , like , the easiest era .
I have seen her at work , but i always figured , ah huh ?
but , uh , i made her dinner .
we had a great time .
and we are going out again tomorrow .
well maybe she and her friends are just having a contest to see who can bring home the biggest geek .
fine by me ; hope she wins .
hi .
you guys have any wrapping paper ?
oo !
is it for my birthday present ?
phebes , it was your birthday , like , months ago .
yeah , but remember you said you ordered something special , and it just has not come yet ?
well , i have a call in about that .
'kay .
actually , this is for kathy's birthday .
it is an early edition of her favorite book .
oh , the velveteen rabbit !
oh my god , when the boy's love makes the rabbit real !
okay , but do not touch it , because you fingers have destructive oils .
huh .
well , then you would better keep it away from ross's hair .
so this is pretty rare .
how did you get that ?
oh , it was not a big deal .
i just went to a couple of bookstores , talked to a couple of dealers .
.
.
called a couple of the author's grandchildren .
oh , honey , that is so sweet .
yeah , and what a great way to say , i secretly love you , roommate's girlfriend !
it does not say that .
does it ?
how do you think it is going to look when you get her something incredibly meaningful and expensive and her boyfriend joey gives her an orange ?
okay , all right , I will just uh , make sure that uh , joey gets her something really great .
it is got to be better than that book .
oo !
like a crossbow !
yeah , once again , i am sorry .
thank you .
bye .
i just had to turn down a job catering a funeral for sixty people .
oh my god !
what happened ?
sixty guests .
so , uh , why did you have to turn it down ?
because i do not have the money or the equipment to handle something that big on such short notice .
i mean there is no way .
wow , what is with all the negativity ?
you sound like monican't  , not monican .
.
.
.
monica .
look , you know , you have been playing around with this catering thing for over three years .
do you want to be a caterer or not ?
i do not know .
there you go , that is the spirit !
okay !
now , if you need money , i will lend you money , but just get moving !
really ?
because I would need like $500 for all the food and the supplies and stuff .
okay !
it is worth it , if it will get you moving .
you have not worked in months .
well , you are not working either .
yes , but I am doing this .
yeah , that would be great !
thank you !
hey !

you can pee here !
it is okay , the duck's using our bathroom anyway .
hey joe !

we have only been going out for a couple of weeks , do you think i got to get her something ?
yes , you have to get her something , and it should be something really nice .
oh , i know .

.
and not one of your coupons for an hour of joey love .
ooo , a crossword !

no !
I am sorry , honey , it is just that last week i got all but three answers and i really want to finish a whole one without any help .
fine .
but you can not help me develop my new universal language .
hey !
hey , how did it go ?

i mean , everyone loved the food , and guess what ?
i even got another funeral for tomorrow the dead guy from today's best friend .
i mean , it is like i am the official caterer for that accident !

i mean , you told me to go and be a caterer .
so i went .
i beed .
i mean , i .
.
.
i used it to buy all this stuff .
but look I have got another job tomorrow , so I will pay you back with the money i make from that .

look what we almost took !
excuse me , mrs .
burkart ?
well , we are all cleaned up in the kitchen .
um , and , well there is the .
.
the the small matter of .
.
.
just the matter of  .
payment ?
you know what we should all do ?
go see a musical .
sure .
.
.
and you know which one we should see ?
the 1996 tony award winner .
do you happen to know the name of that one ?
i do not know .
.
.
um , grease ?
no .
.
.
.
rent ?
yes !
rent !
okay , so when do you want to go ?
what ?
oh , I am sorry , i can not , I am busy .
hey .
man , it is so hard to shop for girls .
yes , it is , at office max .
what did you get her ?
a pen .
it is two gifts in one .
it is a pen that is also a clock !
huh ?
huh huh !
you can not give her that .
why not ?
because she is not eleven !
and it is not the seventh night of hanukkah !
okay , honey , what he means by that , is  .
while this is a very nice gift , maybe it is just not something a boyfriend gives ?
sure it is !
she needs a pen for work , she is writing , she turns it over .
.
.
.
whoa !
it is time for my date with joey !
all right , look , look .
what did .
.
.
what did you get for angela delveccio for her birthday ?
she did not have a birthday while we were going out .
for three years ?
look , it is too late , and i got an audition .
i can not shop anymore !
i .
.
.
all right .
i will go out and i will try to find something for her , okay ?
thanks , man .
and oh , while you are at it , could you get her a card ?
would you like me to write her a little poem as well ?
or .
.
.
just get a card that has a poem already in it .
but mon , you have to get our money !
oh , phoebe , she could not stop crying !
with those thick glasses , her tears looked giant .
i know , it is tough .
you know what the first thing i did after my mother's funeral was ?
what ?
pay the caterer !
look , I have had a lot of jobs , okay , and there are some people who just always try to get out of paying .
it is either , you know , that massage was not long enough , or , i do not recognize any of those songs ,  or , you know , these sombreros are not big enough .
bad little white girl !
okay .
so what do you .
.
.
.
you think she is faking ?
well , it seems like there were not any tears 'til you showed her the bill .
phoebe , she sounded pretty upset to me .
she seems fine now .
so , you just left ?
her place was really that bad ?
you know how you throw your jacket on a chair at the end of the day ?
yeah .
well , like that , only instead of a chair , it is a pile of garbage .
and instead of a jacket , it is a pile of garbage .
and instead of the end of the day , it is the end of time , and garbage is all that has survived !
here .
wow .
thanks .
so , uh , what happened ?
what do you mean ?
nothing happened !
i had to get out of there .
all right , so .
.
.
next time , you take her to your place .
no , i tried that .
she says it has a weird smell .
what kind of smell ?
i do not know .
soap ?
all right , listen , ross .
.
.
you like this girl , right ?
yeah .
you want to see her again , right ?
yeah .
so you are going to have to do it in the mess !
yeah , okay you are right .
yeah .
i mean , uh , who .
.
.
who cares about a little sloppiness ?
yeah !
it is , uh .
.
.
it is endearing , really .
all right !
now you go get that beautiful pig !
oink !
okay , all right .
i just spent the entire afternoon looking for a present for kathy that would be better than the rabbit .
any luck ?
oh , yeah .
yeah , i found this great place called invisible things for kathy .
can you give me a hand with all this stuff ?
all right , look .
why do not you just return the book , let joey give her the clock pen , and you give her something worse than that .
like .
.
.
a regular pen .
she is really going to love this , you know ?
the bottom line is i want her to have it , even if i do not get to be the one who gives it to her .
aw , honey , that is so sweet .
yeah ?
you do not think it is just pathetic ?
oh !
pathetic !
hey !
I am meeting kathy in ten minutes !
I have been looking all over for you !
where ?
our place , the hall !
i .
.
.
i got something for her .
it is a book !
a book ?
is it like a book that is also a safe ?
no , it is a book that is just a book , okay ?
it is an early edition of the velveteen rabbit .
it was her favorite book as a kid .
so , uh , just .
.
.
let me know if she likes it , okay ?
you got it .
thanks man .
thanks for doing this , i owe you one .
oh , hey !
there was not any change from that twenty , was there ?
no , it came out to an even twenty .

maybe i can try at intermission ?
phoebe , come on .
.
.

hey , we are not leaving until we get paid !
i do not know who she thinks she is !
enough is enough !
hey , widow ?
okay , widow !
excuse me .
excuse me !
thanks .
um , clearly this is a very , very hard time for you .
um , but , um , we provided a service , and we deserve to be paid because you ate that service , and , um , we are not leaving here until we are paid every penny .

it is like if you woke up one day and found out your dad was leading this double life .
he is like actually some spy , working for the c.i.a .
that would be cool .
.
.
.
this blows !
i know , i mean , why can not parents just stay parents ?
why do they have to become people ?
why do they have .
.
.
why can not you stop staring at my breasts ?
what ?
what ?
did you not get a good enough look the other day ?
alright , alright .
we are all adults here , there is only one way to resolve this .
since you saw her boobies , i think , uh , you are going to have to show her your peepee .
y'know , i do not see that happening ?
c'mon , he is right .
tit for tat .
well I am not showing you my 'tat . '
hello ?
it is phoebe .
c'mon up .
oh , good .
rog is here .
what is the matter with rog ?
yeah .
oh , it is nothing , it is a little thing .
.
.
i hate that guy .
what , so he was a little analytical .
that is what he does , y'know ?
c'mon , he is not that bad .
y'see , that is where you are wrong .
why would i marry her if i thought on any level thatthat she was a lesbian ?
why ?
why would i why ?
why ?
why ?
why ?
wait wait , go back to that sibling thing .
that that is ridiculous !
i do not feel guilty for her failures !
oh !
so you think I am a failure !
is not he good ?
nonono , thatthat's not what i was saying .
.
.
y'know , all these years , i thought you were on my side .
but maybe what you were doing was sucking up to mom and dad so they would keep liking you better !
hey , i married a lesbian to make you look good !
you are right !
i mean you are right !
it was not just the weebles , but it was the weeble play palace , and and the weebles ' cruise ship .
oh , which had this little lifeboat for the weebles to wobble in .
oh , okay .

joey , if i go first , i want to be looking for my keys .
dad , ronni's here .
so , who is up for a big game of kerplunk ?
who ah ho .
no you will not .
if you go to a hotel you will be .
doing stuff .
i want you right here where i can keep an eye on you .
that is right , mister , and i do not care how old you are , as long as you are under my roof you are going to live by my rules .
and that means no sleeping with your girlfriend .
now dad , you will be in my room , ronni uh , you can stay in chandler's room .
c'mon , I will show you to my room .
.
that sounds so weird when it is not followed by no thanks , it is late .
okay .
now this is just for tonight .
starting tomorrow , you got to make a change .
this has gone on long enough .
well , either you break it off with ronni then you got to come clean with ma !
this is not right !
i do not want to hear it !
now go to my room !
hey , kicky .
what are you doing ?
just trying to get comfortable .
i can not sleep in my underwear .
well , you are going to .
I have been thinking .
y'know , about how I am always seeing girls on top of girls .
.
.
are they end to end , or tall like pancakes ?
y'know what i mean , about how I am always going out with all these women .
and i always figured , when the right one comes along , I would be able to be a stand up guy and go the distance , y'know ?
now I am looking at my dad , thinking .
.
.
hey , you are not him .
you are you .
when they were all over you to go into your father's pipe fitting business , did you cave ?
no .
no .
you decided to go into the out of work actor business .
now that was not easy , but you did it !
and I would like to believe that when the right woman comes along , you will have the courage and the guts to say no thanks , I am married .
you really think so ?
yeah .
i really do .
thanks , chandler .
get off !
hi .
may i help you ?
okay .
who are you ?
oh , c'mon in .
hi , I am rachel .
bathroom's up there .
hey , listen , ronni , how long would you say chandler's been in the shower ?
perfect .
fasten your seatbelts , it is peepee time .
hey , mr .
trib .
chandler bing ?
it is time to see your thing .
what is the matter with you ?
!
i thought it was chandler !
what ?
what ?
you were supposed to be in there so i could see your thing !
sorry , my my thing was in there with me .
hey .
how is it going ?
good .
oh oh !
roger's having a dinner thing and he wanted me to invite you guys .
so what is going on ?
nothing , um , it is just , um .
.
.
it is roger .
i dunno , there is just something about .
.
.
basically we just feel that he is .
.
.
we hate that guy .
we are sorry , pheebs , we are sorry .
uh huh .
okay .
okay , do not you think , maybe , though , it is just that he is so perceptive that it freaks you out ?
we are sorry .
ma !
what are you doing here ?
oww !
big ring !
hold on , you you knew ?
so then how could you i mean , how could you ?
!
ma , i do not mean to be disrespectful , but .
.
.
what the hell are you talking about ?
!
i mean , what about you ?
I am .
happy .
for you ?
ma , I am sorry .
i just did what i thought you would want .
yeah .
you are ten times prettier than she is .
with this ring ?
no contest .
nothing , nothing .
it is , i mean , it is nothing , I am fine .
it is my friends .
they they have a liking problem with you .
in that , um , they do not .
but they do not see all the wonderfulness that i see .
they do not see all the good stuff and all the sweet stuff .
they just think you are a little .
.
.
intense and creepy .
but i do not .
me , phoebe .
you are not ?
see , that is why you are so great !
so you talked to your dad , huh .
yeah .
he is going to keep cheating on my ma like she wanted , she is going to keep pretending she does not know even though she does , and my little sister tina can not see her husband any more because he got a restraining order .
which has nothing to do with anything except that i found out today .
wow .
things sure have changed here on waltons mountain .
so joey , you okay ?
yeah , i guess .
it is just parents , after a certain point , you got to let go .
even if you know better , you have got to let them make their own mistakes .
just think , in a couple of years we get to turn into them .
if i turn into my parents , I will either be an alcoholic blond chasing after twenty year old boys , or .
.
.
I will end up like my mom .
hey .
how is it going ?
oh , okay , except i broke up with roger .
yeah , right .
what happened ?
i do not know , i mean , he is a good person , and he can be really sweet , and in some ways i think he is so right for me , it is just .
.
.
i hate that guy !
hey , joey .
what is going on ?
clear the tracks for the boobie payback express .
next stop : rachel green .
joey !
!
what the hell were you doing ?
!
sorry .
wrong boobies .
hello , joey .
let me ask you , why is everybody using these tiny lights nowadays ?
i remember when people used to use big lights .
that s a good story , grandpa .
hey wow , monica s letting other people help decorate her tree !
did someone get her drunk again or ?
having a perfectly decorated tree is not what christmas is about .
it s about being with the people that you love .
that is nice and we re done .
tada !
i dunno what it is , it just doesn t quite feel like christmas to me .
oh , here .
see now it feels like christmas !
and that s the story of the dreidle .
now , some people trace the christmas tree back to the egyptians , who used to bring green palm branches into their huts on the shortest day of the year , symbolising life s triumph over death .
and that was like 4000 years ago .
so , pretty much around the same time that you started telling this story .
hey you guys .
hey joe what s up ?
i had to get out of the apartment .
janine is like stretching all over the place .
y know , everywhere i look she s like   i can see why that s hard to resist .
i like her so much !
aw , i m sorry sweetie that she doesn t feel the same way .
i know .
and she s so sweet .
i just want to feed her grapes and brush her hair .
you are aware that she s not a monkey , right ?
i am so over janine .
i mean , yeah , at first i thought she was hot , but now she s like old news !
hi janine !
hold it !
are you talking about dick clark s new year s rocking eve ?
oh my god !
we love that show !

y know ?
but if she says  dude , what the hell are you doing ?

chandler , aren t you worried about what to get monica for christmas ?
no , i have a great idea for a present for her .

chandler , that s not enough .
i mean what if she gets you a great present , two medium presents , and a bunch of little presents ?

we are so going to find them this year .
y know when you guys said you were going to go across the hall and look , you don t , you don t do that every year do you ?

you don t , like go into the back of my closet , and look under my gym bag or anything ?

okay , that did not just happen !
okay , here comes another camera .

oh yeah ?
well when you learned how to dance did you forget how to put on underpants ?

hey !
tall guy !

y know if mom and dad don t see us on tv after we made them so jealous , i mean , who s going to be the losers then ?
hey , i know what ll get us up on a platform !
what ?
the routine !
ross , we haven t done the routine since middle school .
hey , when the snippy guy sees the routine , he ll want to build us our own platform !
was it really that good ?
we got honourable mention in the brother/sister dance category !
look , it s almost fake midnight , do we really have any other choice ?
okay , let s do it .
mom and dad are going to be so faced !
5 6 7 8 !
so , do we really have to ask who s going up on the platform next ?
yes !
uh , take a look at the guy s pants !
i mean , i know you told us to show excitement , but don t you think he went a little overboard ?
yeah , take a hike wetpants !
can you believe this ?
we re going to be on the platform for the millennium moment !
i know !
hey , you haven t been practising the routine , have you ?
no !
me too !
hey , when the music starts up again , i was thinking of maybe goind into the robot , y know ?
ross , i think we should stick to the routine , we don t want to look stupid !
no !

happy no year !
hey !
look who i found !
oh , hey guys !
y know , birds have a very good sense of direction , and i thought maybe they could help us find where the presents are hidden .
yes , if the presents are hidden south for the winter .
or we could just follow your clever jokes   any ideas ?
no !
didn t think so !
okay , c mon guys , show us where the presents are !

and who was going to be your best man ?
don t say , ross .
do not say , ross .
look , i just don t think monica and i are ready to get married yet !
y know ?
i mean , i love her and everything but seeing ross and rachel coming out of that chapel was like a , like a wake up call that monica and i are moving so fast .
y know ?
and , how do i tell her without crushing her ?
oh !
tell her she s not marriage material .
what ?
!
girls say it to me all the time !
and believe me , if she s anything like me , she s just going to be relieved .
how do i tell chandler that it s too soon .
it s going to break his heart , he s not going to think that i don t love him anymore .
well you don t .
yes i do !
good !
good !
i was just testing you .
hi .
oh hi !

rach !
we weren t going to miss our friends getting married !
who got married ?

hello !
we didn t get married .
no , we didn t get married !
that s ridiculous !
we we we i remember being in a chapel .
oh my god .
i they would not let us get married when we were that drunk !
no !
they let you get married when you re drunk !
most people who get married in vegas are drunk !
hell , i m drunk right now !
what ?
i can t have a mimosa with breakfast ?
!
i m on vacation !
what are you guys going to do ?
well , i guess we just find a divorce lawyer ?
well , i think , i think , ross already has one .
now , this one s free , right ?
because you paid for the first two , so the third one s free .
laugh it up , but the joke s on you .
because we don t need to get divorced , okay ?
we we re just going to get an annulment .
an annulment ?
ross !
i don t think surgery s the answer here .
oh oh , that s your thing .
what ?
you re thing .
you re thing .
y know ?
you re the guy who gets divorced .
no no , that s that s not my thing !
i do not love getting divorced !
yes you do !
this is your third divorce !
you love divorce so much you re probably going to marry it !
then it won t work out and you re going to have to divorce it , divorcing guy .
i m so drunk .
so , what do you think we should do ?
i don t know .
but i i i know i love you !
i know i love you !
so where are we on the whole going back to the place where they have all the marriages thing ?
i love you .
that s a good question .
look umm , last night we let the dice decide .
maybe we should leave it up to fate again .
i love you !
yes , we don t get married unless there s a sign !
okay , so say uh , say you roll another eight  then there s a definite sign that we should get married .
all right , eight we get married , but 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 we don t get married .
sounds great .
okay .
ready ?
ready !
come on eight .
yes , yes eight .
wow !
i can t believe i actually rolled an eight .
that was so unlikely .
well , let s get married !
i guess .
wait a minute .
that wasn t a hard eight !
last night i rolled a hard eight .
that s right !
it was the wrong kind of eight , no wedding !
damnit !
i wanted it so bad !
want to go pack ?
yeah .
we re doing the right thing , right ?
ohh , of course we are !
we left it up to fate .
if we were supposed to get married there would be a clear cut sign .
okay , you have 19 questions left .
use them wisely .
come on joey !
you can t win if you don t ask any  questions !
!
!
what ?
!
well , you promised me a fun road trip !
we ve been on the road six hours and you ve been asleep for five and a half !
we are switching at the next rest stop and you are going to drive all the way back !
that will be your punishment , you greedy sleeper !
all right .
all right .
yeah !
and until then you are going to sing to me because the radio s broken and you are selfish but have a nice voice .
really ?
i don t  sing !
!
i want to rock and roll all night !
man , this is a long drive !
are my eyes open ?
no !
hey !
hey , hubby !
yeah .
yeah , actually um , i wanted to talk to you about that whole annulment thing ?
uh huh .
i m not going to do that .
okay !
so , we ll just stay married .
yes , exactly !
and i will make everyone call me mrs .
geller !
wow !
this is so amazing .
i uh , i really thought i d have to talk you into this more .
okay , see now i m scared because i don t actually think you re kidding .
i m i m not kidding .
look i i , i can t have three failed marriages .
i can t .
okay ?
i i am not going to be that guy !
what wh what so we ll just stay married forever ?
!
okay , look , how is this going to affect you ?
really ?
i mean you fill some form out once and a while and instead of checking the box that says ms you check the box that says mrs .
!
it s right next to it !
ohh , okay , i m sorry .
you re right .
y know what ?
we absolutely can stay married , because i was under the impression that the boxes were far away from each other .
all right , look , just please , take a moment here and think about what you re asking of me .
i m asking you to do me a favor .
you are asking me to be your wife !
and as my wife i think you should grant me this favor .
that kid really kicked me hard on the plane .
well you did pull his hair .
he took my snack !
i m not getting into this again !
okay !
oh god , y know what ?
it s really bad .
well , i told you not to walk .
here .
there .
okay .
this doesn t mean anything , does it ?
no !
okay .
how could you pick up a hitchhiker ?
!
he could be a rape  , a rapist or a killer or something !
don t you think i asked him that before he got in ?
!
y know what ?
i m not talking to you !
you go back to sleep !
and you , are you a rapist ?

i ll play !
no no !
you need your sleep .
night night !
shh !
hey !
hey !
listen , i know you wanted to talk to me , but i have an idea that may make you want to stay married .
we register , and you get to keep all the presents !
no !
ross , come on !
no !
listen , look i thought a lot about how to tell you this and the bottom line , ross , is we can not stay married .
i don t know if it s true .
oh b b but it is !
oh , okay , y know what this is ?
this is a difference of opinion .
and when that happens in a marriage .
.
.
oh ross , come on !
this is not , this is not a marriage !
!
this is the world s worst hangover !
ross , listen , if you do not get this annulment , i will !
all right .
all right , i ll do it .
thank you .
hey hey umm , uh , is there , is there any such thing as an annulment shower ?
oh , okay .

i will prove it to you !
okay ?
about a week ago i was wearing those jeans and i dropped a pen in my lap and it left an ink stain on the crotch .
now when she comes back i will find it and show you that stain !
honey , isn t it possible that the company that sold the jeans made more than just the one pair ?
i guess .
so , shouldn t we go give her the benefit of the doubt before we go snooping around her crotch ?
fine .
i m just glad i didn t give her my secret ingredient .
out of curiosity , what is your secret ingredient ?
yeah !
hi !
yeah , me too .
not in the shaky angry way you are though .
oh .
yeah .
yeah .
maybe this is too weird .
no don t tear out your eyes !
!
oh , yeah try that .
so , is that better ?
look eric , turn around .
look , i like you , but it shouldn t be this hard .
y know ?
this is our first date y know ?
first dates are supposed to be about excitement and electricity and  ooh , he just touched my hand , did he mean to touch my hand ?
and y know first kisses and second kisses .
thanks for the coffee , or bedankt voor de koffie , gunter .

no no , i i have to see if this apartment became available .
oh , you re switching apartments ?
it s not for me , it s for rachel .
but rachel has an apartment .
yeah , but when the baby comes she s going to want to move .

yeah , you didn t expect her to live there with a baby did you ?
i guess i didn t really think about it .
ezel !
hey gunther !
you re an ezel !
damnit !
nice jeans !
oh .
you re not gettin  it .
oh , i fell asleep .
oh , will you do the top of the cabinets ?
that ll really work up your appetite for lunch .
hello .
i m sorry .
i ve never had a maid before , is this not okay ?
hey !
hey !
how was the game ?
oh , okay .
i i ate way too much .
oh .
ooh .
so umm , i was talkin  to ross and he said you were looking for a new place .
oh yeah !
hopefully across the street if certain dutch people would just let go .
i was kind of hoping you d stay .
oh but joey , i have to go .
there s no room for a baby here .
no room ?
it s a baby .
it s like this big .
y know , i mean you you could you could put it over here .
or or or we could put it right here .
aw , it s cute , right ?
or or we could put it over here .
you wouldn t even notice it .
where s the baby ?
honey , it s not just a matter of where you put it .
i mean a baby changes everything .
they cry all the time .
i mean imagine bringing home some girl and trying to score when there s a screaming baby around .
i could use a challenge !
it s getting pretty easy .
honey , it s so sweet that you want me to stay , but i i can t do that to you .
i mean it would disrupt your entire life .
i love living with you so much .
i just wish things didn t have to change .
i know .
y know i blame ross for this .
i do too a little bit .
i m going to miss you , you re the hottest roommate i ever had .
ooh , oh no !
i have to go !
i have a massage appointment .
no , i got in trouble for that before .
i ll see you later .
really ?
that s the thing i m worse at !
you ll see .
hi !
hey !
umm , i think brenda needs a raise .
how come ?
because i put my head between her legs .
to see her pants ?
they re my pants !
are you sure ?
did you see the stain ?
no !
i was just getting into position and then everything went dark .
god !
she is not stealing from us !
okay , will you let this go ?
fine .
she s wearing my bra !
oh dear god !
my pink flowered bra !
i recognize the strap !
and yet you don t recognize that you re crazy .
here s the plan !
okay ?
i m going to leave you get a look at brenda s bra !
here s another plan no !
i would do it but she thinks i m attracted to her !
why ?
did you not hear where my head was ?
come on !
come on we re a team !
we re in this together !
i fear a jury will see it the same way !
do this for me !
come on , i catch you looking at woman s breasts all the time !
you see that ?
do you see this ?
all right .
yes .
okay .
i get your point .
but if it s not your bra will you just let the woman clean the apartment ?
!
yes !
absolutely .
okay ?
look , you ll know it s mine because on the right cup , the lacey part , there s a very noticeable rip .
you need new clothes .
hi .
how is she ?
oh .
oh .
well i uh , i brought her some bloemen .
oh i don t know that it would .
all right then .
hey !
hey !
can we pick up where we left off ?
why ?
what sex ?
we didn t have sex .
ew !
ew !
ew !
ew !
ew !
ew !
you you you had sex with ursula ?
!
you didn t notice she was wearing different clothes ?
!
oh .
ew !
ew !
ew !
ugh !
y know what ?
this is too weird .
so i guess this is it .
yeah , so do you .
i m leaning .
this is where i lean .
brenda a bee !
yes !
it s flown into your blouse and you d better undo your buttons lest it sting you !
you do ?
i totally understand .
can i just see your bra ?
hi !
where did you get those jeans ?
!
you gave them to me !
no i didn t !
all right , i took them .
but i figured it would be okay because you got a big ink stain on the crotch .
oh no !
did you take my bra too ?
!
what bra ?
the pink one with the flowers ?
!
you mean the one that you re wearing ?
sounds about right .
what is this ?
hey !
uh , this is just to give you an idea .
okay well , we can put screens here ,  so that the baby has privacy , and and and maybe a mobile over the crib .
and uh oh look !
here s a baby monitor  , which until the baby comes we can use as walkie talkies .
huh ?
you re so sweet .
oh my god !
and you gave the baby hugsy !
ahhhhhhhhhhhh  .
that that that s really just to show where the baby would go .
y know why don t i hold on to him so that there s no confusion ?
but joey the baby is going to be crying , it s going to be loud .
i m loud !
it s going to be up all night !
i m up all night !
it s going to poop !
hello !
what about all the women you want to bring home ?
look , if i m bringing home a woman who can t stand being around a baby , then maybe i don t want to be with that woman !
or maybe we ll just do it in the bathroom of the club !
joey , are you sure ?
yeah !
all right look , i know sometimes it ll be hard , okay ?
but , it ll also be really really great .
please rachel !
i i i really want you to stay .

i mean they tell you anything you want to hear like like , you look 19 ,  and then they just take it away like like , no you don t .
well , i don t think monica is going to take this away .
wouldn t she ?
would she ?

you ate my candy bar !
guess who ?
hey .
hey , i just realized we kind of let some stuff up in the air  what do you think monica mean when she said she didn t want to talk , especially with me ?
i mean , why not especially you and me ?
we were both out there kissing .
still thinking about it huh ?
come on !
serious ser ser seriously , what did she mean by that ?
especially you !
oh , who cares ?
i care !
and so do i .
y know what , i i have to go talk to her , would you let me just get changed ?
okay .
sure .
am i going to let you watch me undress ?
no !
i can t believe her , y know it s just it s so typical .
now monica , i know you re upset , but don t forget .
there is going to be a wedding , you are going to throw the bouquet , and then there s going to be a honeymoon , maybe in paris .
paris ?
we will take a moonlit walk on the rue de la  .
keep talking .
then we will sprinkle rose pedals on the bed and make love .
not just because it s romantic , but because i can !
i love you !
bonjour , monsieur .
okay , don t say anything , you might scare it away .
it s paris , who knows we re here !
hi pheebs , what s up ?
okay , you said i could sing at your wedding so , i m just going to need a small deposit .
what ?
!
y know , just some good faith money to hold the date .
pheebs , we re not giving you a deposit for our wedding !
oh , i see .
they break your heart , don t they ?
y know , i don t really their permission .
yeah !
if you want to sing at their wedding , well you sing at their wedding !
yeah !
and if you want to look 19 , then you  you got to do something about your eyes .
what ?
!
what s wrong with my eyes .
they give you away !
there s just there s just too much wisdom in there .
just put some tea bags on there for like 15 minutes .
and that ll get rid of my wisdom ?
maybe just 10 minutes for you .
oh , give her the deposit !
give her the ring !
i don t care !
yes .
monica , what did you mean before when you said you didn t want to talk to anyone , especially me ?
what a great apology !
and you accept !
okay , bye bye !
no no , seriously seriously , what was the especially me part about ?
well , let s just say it s not the first time you ve stolen my thunder .
what ?
!
hey , here s a thought .
monica , what are you talking about ?
my sweet sixteen !
remember , you went to third base with my cousin charlie .
ahh , third base .
it s all everybody at the party could talk about !
monica , y know what ?
the only reason i did that was because your party was so boring !
we had a characturist !
oh !
!
monica , your sweet sixteen was like a million years ago .
and yet , here we are doing it again .
ugh , monica i don t want to steal your stupid thunder !
oh please !
why else would you have made out with ross ?
!
got me .
all right , easy mimey , the moment has passed , it ain t going to happen !
i just thought it would be nice if i could have just this one night !
i swear , i never wanted any part of your night !
oh , is that why you did it the secret hallway where nobody ever goes ?
!
uh , rachel , i ve been thinking .
i don t think us getting together tonight is such a good idea .
i m calling it off .
why to save your dignity my man .
monica , why ?
why would i ever want to take away from your night ?
i don t know !
i don t maybe you re feeling a little resentful .
maybe ah , maybe you thought you d get married first !
maybe you can t stand the fact that your formally fat friend is getting married before you !
oh wow .
that y know what ?
that is so unfair .
y know what ?
now i want to steal your thunder !
come on ross , let s go have sex !
i can t believe you re going to have sex on my engagement night !
!
well , somebody should .
look uh , if we re going to do this  we re not going to do this , all right ?
she s just going to think that we re doin  it .
oh , i see , so everybody wins .
who is it ?
it s monica , open up !
okay well ross !
stop it please !
wait a minute !
oww !
yeah , you like that baby ?
may we help you ?
i just wanted to say that i hope you do have sex tonight and i hope that you guys get back together , but i must warn you , the night that you announce your engagement i m going to announce that i m pregnant !
how is that ever going to happen ?
!
all right monica , do you want to know why i was with ross tonight ?
!
i know why !
no you don t know why !
okay !
why ?
!
because !
because i was sad .
what do you mean ?
look , i am so so happy for you guys , but you getting married just reminds me of the fact that i m not .
i m not even close .
and i don t know , maybe i just wanted to make myself feel better .
and i know that that s dumb , but oh my god you were so depressed when ross got married that you slept with chandler !
i don t care , she slept with me .
anyway sweetie , i am , i m so sorry i ruined your night .
i m sorry i almost made you sleep with ross .
well , i m going to take off .
congratulations man .
thanks .
and uh , rachel .
yeah .
what can i say , you missed your chance .
from now on the only person who s going to enjoy these bad boys  is me .
hey !
here s a dollar , consider it a deposit .
please sing at our wedding .
oh thank you .
okay .
now   who will perform the ceremony !
who will perform the cer oh oh !
all right , i ll pound on him in the morning .
i can not believe you would actually say that .
i would much rather be mr.peanut than mr.salty .
no way !
mr.salty is a sailor , all right , he is got to be , like , thetoughest snack there is .
i do not know , you do not want to mess with corn nuts .
they are craaazy .
oh my god .

i feel violated .
and not in a good way .
how can people do that ?
.
.
.
oh , you guys , look !
ugly naked guy got gravity boots !
i am telling you , years from now , schoolchildren will study it as one of the greatest first dates of all time .
it was unbelievable !
we could totally be ourselves , we did not have to play any games .
.
.
so have you called her yet ?
let her know i like her ?
what are you , insane ?
it is the next day !
how needy do i want to seem ?
I am right , right ?
i can not believe my parents are actually pressuring me to find one of you people .
oh , god , just do it !
call her !
stop being so testosteroney !
which , by the way , is the real san francisco treat .
i got her machine .
her answer machine ?
no , interestingly enough her leaf blower picked up .
so , uh , why did not you say anything ?
oh , no no no no .
last time i left a spontaneous message i ended up using the phrase yes indeedy of .
look look !
it is rachel and barry .
no , do not everybody look at once !
okay , okay , what is going on ?
okay , they are just talking .
.
.
yeah , well , does he look upset ?
does he look like he was just told to shove anything ?
no , no actually , he is smiling .
.
and .
.
.
oh my god , do not do that !
!
what ?
what ?
what ?
!
that man across the street just kicked that pigeon !
oh !
and basically , that is how a bill becomes a law .
hey rach !
how did it go ?
y'know , it was , uh .
.
it was actually really great .
he took me to lunch at the russian tea room , and i had that chicken , where y'know you poke it and all the butter squirts out .
.
.
not a good day for birds .
.
.
then we took a walk down to bendall's , and i told him not to , but he got me a little bottle of chanel .
.
.
that is nice .
.
.
now , was that before or after you told him to stop calling , stop sending you flowers and to generally leave you alone , hmm ?
right , .
.
well , .
.
we never actually got to that .
.
.
oh , it was just so nice to see him again , y'know ?
it was comfortable , it was familiar .
.
.
it was just nice !
that is , that is nice twice !
rachel , what is going on ?
i mean is not this the same barry who you left at the altar ?
duh , where have you been ?
yeah , but it was different with him today !
and he was not , like , orthodontist guy , y'know ?
i mean , we had fun !
is there anything wrong with that ?
yes !
why ?
i have my reasons .
okay , how about the fact that he is engaged to another woman , who just happens to be your ex best friend ?
all right .
all right , all right , all right , all right , i know it is stupid !
i will go see him this afternoon , and i will just put an end to it !
wow .
.
.
wow !
I am not crazy , right ?
i mean , it was never like that .
ooh , and it is so nice having this little sink here .
.
.
oh , danielle !
i was not expecting the machine .
.
.
give me a call when you get a chance .
bye bye .
oh god !
that is what you have been working on for the past two hours ?
!
hey , I have been honing !
what was with the dishes ?
oh , uh .
.
i want her to think i might be in a restaurant .
.
y'know ?
i might have some kind of life , like i have not been sitting around here honing for the past few hours .
look look !
he is doing it again , the guy with the telescope !
oh my god !
go away !

this morning , i caught him looking into our apartment .
it creeps me out !
i feel like i can not do stuff !
what kind of stuff ?
will you grow up ?
I am not talking about sexy stuff , but , like , when I am cooking naked .

can i use your phone ?
yeah .
.
uh , but for future reference , that thing in your hand can also be used as a phone .
yes , it is working !
why is not she calling me back ?
maybe she never got your message .
y'know , if you want , you can call her machine , and if she has a lot of beeps , that means she probably did not get her messages yet .
y'do not think that makes me seem a little .
.
.
.
desperate , needy , pathetic ?
ah , you obviously saw my personal ad .
how many beeps ?
she answered .
y'see , this is where you would use that 'hello ' word we talked about .
I am not going to talk to her , she obviously got my message and is choosing not to call me .
now I am needy and snubbed .
god , i miss just being needy .
how did he take it ?
pretty well , actually .
.
.
uh , rach .
.
.

uh   which one of us are you talking to there , barr ?
even when we were having sex in that chair ?

during that second time you could not have picked her out of a lineup !
well , the first time did not really count .
.
.
i mean , y'know , 's'barry .
okay .
okay , we will be here !
hating you !
did you see how he was sweating when he walked out of there ?
listen honey , if I am hogging the ball too much you just jump right in there and take a couple punches because I am telling you , this feels great .
what are you talking about ?
!
mindy , the guy is the devil !
he is satan in a smock !
oh god .
and i hope barry does not kill you and eat you in aruba .
you okay ?
yeah .

y'know , ever since i ran out on barry at the wedding , i have wondered whether i made the right choice .
and now i know .
aww .
.
.
big day .
all right , I will give you this , mr .
peanut is a better dresser .
i mean he is got the monocle , he is got the top hat .

.
.
okay .
whoo hoo !
yeah , there you go !
second date !
.
i dunno .
you do not know ?
!
well , she seems very nice and everything , but that whole thing about her coming all the way down here , just to see if i was okay ?
i mean , .
.
.
how needy is that ?
hey guys !
hi !
hey !
we need to talk to you about something .
yeah .
we do not feel like we can host thanksgiving this year .
hey !
are you kidding ?
well , it is just with uhm , work and the stress of adoption , we just do not feel like we have the energy .
plus , we do not think it is fair that every year the burden falls on us .
that does not sound like you .
.
.
that is monica talking !
no , no !
we made this decision together .
she is putting words in your mouth !
do not you put words in people's mouths , you put turkey in people's mouths !
i can not believe this !
this is emma's first thanksgiving !
no , it is not !
it is not ?
when was she born ?
well , personally i think it is great you are giving yourself a break .
thank you , pheebs !
sure .
it is just as well .
.
.
i mean , last year was not very good .
i think she is losing her touch .
what ?
you are way off , lady !
am i ?
really ?
am i ?
well , why do not you cook thanksgiving dinner and prove me wrong !
well , think about it , think about it , you will be trying to top than you did last year .
you would be in competition .
.
.
with yourself .
that is my favourite kind !
okay , we are doing this !
do not let yourself get manipulated this way !
hey , stay out of this , chandler !
this is between me .
.
.
and me !
we are supposed to make these decisions together !
did you not watch the doctor phil i taped for you ?
hey !
hi !
happy thanksgiving !
oh , yeah , happy needless turkey murder day .
you guys , i ordered some chocolate pies from that bakery on bleecker .
could you pick them up for me ?
you are not making the pies yourself ?
no , no , no , i do not make chocolate pies .
when i was younger i i enter in this pie eating contest .
i ate so many that just the thought of them made me sick .
did you at least win the contest ?
2 minutes , 12 pies and a part of one tin !
okay , i see you guys at 4 .
can not wait !
this dinner is going to be so great !
in your face , last year me  !
hey rach .
yeah .
what is emma doing today ?
well , let us see .
.
.
uh .
.
.
i know that she has a meeting with her lawyer and then she has to make a very big poop .
why ?
well , i want to enter her in a baby beauty pageant .
oh my god !
that is the creepiest thing I have ever heard !
okay , but , well , before you say no , my friend susanne is entering her kid and compared to emma she is a real dog !
oh !
phoebe , all babies are beautiful !
oh .
.
.
okay .
phoebe , just the idea of pitting one baby against another , i mean , you know , and judging who is cuter just for a trophy .
.
.
and a thousand dollars .
.
is something I am very interested in !
oh please , do not tell ross .
he still believes that  what is in the inside is important .
.
.
okay , oh , and emma needs a cowgirl outfit for the competition .
where am i going to get a cowgirl outfit on thanksgiving ?
well , i was thinking .
.
.
oh , take the clothes of joey's cabbage patch kid .
yeah !
did someone drop the baton again ?
why come all the way from kansas to do that ?
i do not get older .
i just get better !
you know what just occurred to me ?
this could be our last thanksgiving just the two of us .
i mean , we could be getting a baby soon !
you do not know that .
somebody is going to pick us .
yeah , but we have not heard a thing from the adoption agency and it has been weeks !
I am telling ya !
it is going to happen .
next year it is going to be you , me and the little hemingway bing .
what , he is my favourite author !
name one of his books .
the firm  ?
ok , let us see .
.
.
uhm , okay , the turkey is in the oven , the stuffing is ready .
.
.
you know , you always cook this meal all by yourself .
let me help this year .
oh , chandler , that is sweet .
but you do not have to do everything doctor phil tells you to do .
I am serious , let me do something , just not the turkey or the stuffing , nothing high profile  .
ok , let us see .
.
.
oh , the cranberry sauce , it is easy to make and no one really cares about it .
tell me more .
okay , I am going to go check on something across the hall .
you start by washing these  not with soap !
!
you obviously have not tasted my palmolive potatoes !
hey !
hey , guess what joey has !
three tickets to today's rangers game !
!
dude , i wanted him to guess .
oh .
oh my god !
yeah , they are great seats too !
guess where they are ?
center ice .
did i do something to you ?
hmm , the game's at one .
so ?
dinner is at four , we will never going to make it back .
so we will leave before it is over , we will be back in time .
you say that now , but it could take us a long time to get back home .
plus joey could get lost and and they could have to page us to go pick him up .
dude , two times that happened !
look , monica has been working hard all day , she did not want to host this thing in the first place , we should not go !
he is right , man .
right , i guess .
alright , so see you at four .
okay .
and get ready to taste my very special cranberries .
or should i say .
.
.
chanberries !
that is some gentle comedy , dude .
we are still going at the game , right ?
yeah !
yeah .
hey .
oh phoebe , listen .
well , i think we got to go .
this place is really freaking me out .
I have been watching this guy over there , i do not think he came with a kid !
we can not leave now !
there was this one baby , haley , who was favourite to win and she got croup , so she had to stay home !
this competition just blew wide open , folks !
phoebe , i think .
.
.
it is just too weird , i just saw a one year old running around with pantyhose on !
oh , i know , we should have been more prepared .
it is okay .
now , the way i see it , our real competition now is cameron .
oh my god , they just took her sweater off .
look at those arms !
hello michelin man .
oh , phoebe !
come on !
you know what , it is already three of the clock and they have not even gotten to emma's group yet .
we got to go , we got dinner !
but emma's got what it takes , she could go all the way !
phoebe , you have to calm down .
okay .
rachel , the hottest babies in the tri state area are in this room right now !
i overheard one of the judges say that not one of them holds a candle to emma !
really ?
yeah !
you heard them say that ?
yeah !
all right , okay .
alright , let us give to these babies something to cry about !
good !
oh yay !
let us get down to business !
emma needs some makeup !
no , what ?
well , she is going to look all washed out next to the other contestants !
no phoebe , i am not letting you put makeup on my baby !
why not !
because i already did !
oh , bob , get off the guy !
oh !
what a game , huh ?
i know , yeah .
i can not believe chandler is missing this !
yeah .
i am sorry he is not here too , but i got to say ,  i am really enjoying nacho chair .
yeah , I would probably enjoy it more if you did not keep batting my hand away .
ohhhh !
these seats are great !
i know , i know !
when i was here for holidays on ice  i was sitting so far away michelle kwan could not read my banner !
wow , hey , we would better get going .
if we do not leave right now , we will be late for dinner .
oh , but it is a kind game !
so we are a little late , you know , the girls will be there , let us stay just for one more goal .
i do not know .
.
.
one more fight !
okay .
okay .
where is everybody ?
they are forty five minutes late !
i can not believe they are not here !
i slave and i slave for what ?
they have ruined cranberry day !
how late are we ?
forty five minutes .
wow   here !
okay .
rachel and phoebe are already there , okay ?
so they probably started without us .
we could just slip in and no one needs to know where we were !
you may want to lose the foam finger !
oh , no , no , no , no , no .
you just want to put it on your hand !
hey !
oh !
you are not at thanksgiving ?
no .
.
.
no , we are late !
what are you doing here !
we are late too !
we figured we could be late because you guys were going to be on time  do not point that thing at me , tribbiani !
so , nobody's here ?
monica's going to kill us !
yeah , where were you !
yeah , yeah , what is with the trophy !
uh , we were at the spelling bee !
and i won !
you won an adult thanksgiving day spelling bee .
yes !
y e s .
yes !
let me see this .
.
.
grand supreme little darling , new york division .
yeah .
that is me !
you entered emma into a beauty pageant ?
and it looks like she put makeup on her !
wait a second , wait a second , where have i seen that cowgirl outfit before .
.
.
i can not believe this , she is our daughter !
that you would treat her like some kind of showdog is inexcusable !
she won a thousand dollars !
so this is an annual thing ?
oh !
that is alicia mae emory's outfit !
you guys , there are people in there who are not getting any happier !
yeah .
what are we going to do ?
well , i do not know , you guys figure it out , i got to put emma down for a nap .
all right .
hey rach , while you are in there , throw something on alicia mae .
alright , what are we going to say ?
ooh , we will say that we were mugged !
you can not get mad at someone who is been mugged !
oh , good , that is good , but you do not look like you were mugged !
no .
here   hey !
do you hear something ?
they are out there !
ohhh !
let me see !
oh god , i can not believe this !
they are an hour late and they are just staying out there , talking !
everything is so distorted !
looks like joey has a giant hand !
which says rangers  on it .
they went to the game !
oooh !
they are in for a world of pain !
ross ' shirt is torn .
oh !
they are late and they are sloppy !
alright , emma is napping .
.
.
what happened to your shirt ?
i got mugged .
and they stole my pocket .
we are just .
.
.
we are trying to figure out an excuse .
hey !
ooh !
how about this : we can say that monica told us 5 of the clock , not 4 of the clock .
that way we are right on time !
or .
.
.
or , we can plant pcp in the apartment and call the cops on her .
that would be a good way to get rid of all the pcp we have lying around .
you know what , we just say that she said it was 5 of the clock .
we will just act casual .
we are not late , we are right on time .
we know you are out there .
who do you think its from ?
oh , god .
this is bad .
this is so bad .
well , let us just go in there and face them .
well , I am not going in first .
i bet that vein on monica's forehead is popping like crazy .
i hate that thing , it is like a .
.
.
bolt of lightning .
oh , hey , i have an idea .
why do not we play rock paper scissors , and whoever loses goes in first .
ready ?
.
ah haah !
i win !
!
what is that ?
that is fire .
beats everything .
oh , really ?
does it beat water balloon ?
.
ooh !
well played , phoebe buffay , well played .
alright , enough , enough , come on .
let us just all go in at the same time .
it is locked .
wha .
.
.
?
oh sure , now they lock it , but when they are having sex on the couch , its like : come on in , my butt is surprisingly hairy  .
alright , come on .
.
.
alright , you guys .
we are so sorry we are late .
please let us in , so we can have dinner together .
no !
everything's cold .
the turkey's dried out and the .
.
.
the stuffing is all soggy .
yeah , and there is a bowl of cranberry sauce that .
.
.
what happens to cranberry sauce ?
nothing .
it is fine .
oh thank god !
come on you guys , we are sorry , alri .
.
.
?
our subway broke down .
that is a lie , you went to the game , i can see joey's hand .
for the love of god take it off !
!
you guys , come on , it does not matter why we are late .
we are all here now , please let us in so we can have some of your delicious turkey .
i had a dream once about a fax machine that did that .
that is all the turkey you are going to get .
how are we going to decide who gets this ?
water balloon !
what are we going to do ?
I am starving .
oh , i just remembered .
we do have something to eat .
monica put something in our oven this morning .
oh yeah !
hey , you touch that and you will be sorry .
guys , I would listen to her .
the vein is bigger than I have ever seen it .
huh .
.
.
oh my god it is brussels sprouts .
that is worse than no food .
ha ha !
all you got was monica's stinky brussels sprouts !
stinky ?
!
please let me stay on this side of the door .
oh , i know .
.
.
i still have my old key !
we can just unlock the door .
well , i do not know if that is such a good idea .
they clearly do not want to be with us .
you know what ?
i do not want to be with them either , but it is thanksgiving and we should not want to be together , together .
just get in there and make a face to face apology , you know ?
look them in the eye .
i know i can get them to forgive us .
i do not know .
.
.
I am telling ya .
.
.
i can do it .
yeah , he can do it !
oh !
oh !
it all looks so beautiful : the turkey , the stuffing .
.
.
the cranberries .
.
.
?
oh !
enough !
a monkey could have made  them !
hey listen guys , we feel really terrible .
he is doing that weird eye contact thing .
do not look at him , do not look at him !
come on you guys , we want you to know we are  very very sorry .
right guys ?
i feel terrible .
now let us not ruin this day .
you worked so hard .
let us move past this and try to have a nice meal all together , huh ?
the floating heads do make a good point .
yeah , they do seem to feel pretty bad .
so bad .
so bad .
okay , okay .
you two  go get the dessert .
and I will let you in .
dessert ?
yeah , i asked you and phoebe to pick up the pies .
you did remember , right ?
pies , oh , we thought you said priiiize  .
here !
.
grand supreme little darling ?
congratulatioooons !
oh my god !
you forgot the pies ?
well , i cannot believe this .
you force me to make dinner , then you are an hour late and you forget the one little thing that i asked you to do .
really girls , not cool .
well , you manheads are not any better .
you lied about going to the game .
you knew it would make you late , and you still went anyway .
hey !
I am getting a little tired of this okay ?
we said we are sorry .
it is thanksgiving for pete's sakes !
a day of forgiveness !
it is a day to be thankful .
do not make me come up there !
it is too late for apologies .
fine !
let us just go .
i do not need your stupid dinner .
that would be a lot more convincing if you were not drooling .
ewww , is that what that is ?
sorry !
come on you guys , let us just do our own thanksgiving .
yeah !
I will cook !
yeah !
let us go out .
hey !
yeah !

I am really wedged in here .
I will pull you through .
okay .
aaw ahhh aaahhh stop !

I am worried about damaging my head .

alright , hurry up , you got to do something .
alright , well , this does not change anything .
okay , we need to get something to grease the sides of his face .

chandler , where are your tools ?
oh , i left them on my bulldozer .
.
.
i do not have tools !
i do , but rachel borrowed them .
i lent them to ross .
i gave them to joey .
i left them at the park .
oh !
I am finding it really hard not to mess with him .
I have already stuffed a bunch of brussel sprouts down his pants .
nice !
okay , i have to get that .
now when i get back , i want you and your friends to be gone .
thanksgiving is over .
the vein has spoken .
it is really starting to hurt .
okay , look , I am going to pull on the door and you guys push as hard as you can .
maybe we can get enough room to wiggle him out , okay ?
okay , so push !
just a sec .

ooh !
stop putting things down my pants !
come on guys , push !
yeah !

hey , I am more cop than you two !
how do you figure that ?
hello !
I am in the front seat , okay ?
I am gary's partner !
y'know , when you say partner it does not sound cop .
it , it sounds gay .
umm , jealous !
yeah , no problem .
sorry !
sorry !
oh ,  there !
hey gary , who am i ?
phone home !
look at officer ross riding back here with the visitors .
yeah , what is up with that serpico ?
nooo !
i know !
well thank god you were here !
i mean , we have to erase that !
what ?
!
we can not do that !
we have too !
i mean what if ross's hears that and then calls her back and then they get back together ?
is that what you want ?
ross back with that controlling , neurotic , crazy emily ?
the emily that would not let him see you ?
noo !
oh no !
no !
god no !
he should not get back together with her .
i know that !
you know that !
even ross knows that !
but that still doesn t give us the right to erase his message !
I am his sister , okay ?
i love him !
i do not want to see him get hurt !
come on !
doesn t that give me the right to control him help him ?
i do not think he is the one who needs help .
no , look , she is obviously unstable , okay ?
i mean she is thinking about running out on her wedding day .
okay , fine !
but i mean , look at the position she is putting him in !
what is he going to do ?
ross is going to run over there on the wedding day and break up the marriage ?
!
i mean , who would do that ?
!
okay , fine , all right , but that is y'know , it is different !
although it did involve a lot of the same people .
ugh !
y'know what , this is obviously some kind of twisted joke she is trying to play on him .
okay , you are crazy !
I am sorry , but she sounded generally upset !
i mean , listen !
noooooooo !
okay , y'know , we we are safe right ?
i mean nothing bad can go down !
what is it ?
oh , hurry up .
i want to sign that .
what ?
what ?
what ?
what is it ?
is everything okay ?
what is going on ?
you okay man ?
uh huh .
thank joey !
uh , hello !
!
hi .
all right , i guess we should go .
no , wait .
wait .
oh yeah right !
no , monica !
monica !
we have to fix this !
there is nothing we can do .
you erased the message !
yeah well unless we tell him .
well , if you are going to be totally rational about this , i can not argue with you !
all right ?
fine , if you want to tell him , tell him .
i just do not want to be a part of it .
oh , maybe that is emily calling back to leave the exact same message .
hey ross !
it is you !
i just want you to remember this feeling .
you are lucky to be alive !
so live everyday to the fullest .
love yourself , okay ?
okay .
oh , and also get stamps .
bye !
wow !
play that message for emily and this whole problem goes away !
right ?
john glenn is here ?
!
pheebs , we had the most incredible night !
okay , so , we are in the car  hi !
okay , okay , so we are in the car .
right ?
and bang !
a shot was fired .
and joey with no regard for his own safety throws himself on me !
my god , joey !
it was a car backfire !
yeah , but but he did not know that !
yeah , i did not know that .
and it could have just as easily have been a bullet .
who jumps at loud noises !
wow !
i could have died tonight .
yeah !
if the car that backfired had run over you !
y'know what , i think I will go home before ross starts rambling about his newfound respect for life .
i do have a newfound respect for life .
oh my god !
yeah !
sure !
yep !
oh , y'know what ?
if i heard a shot right now , I would throw my body on you .
okay !
bye !
cut it out ross !
i hate to have to save your life and kick your ass in the same day !
dude !
how come you took off ?
oh , i just went for a walk , around the living room .
whatever  is something wrong ?
no .
no I am just tired .
y'know , from from the walk .
okay .
you dove in front of ross !
ross !
that is what this is about !
oh my god , you hate ross !
i do not hate ross !
of course you do !
i saved him !
you are mad at me !
it all adds up !
you want ross out of the picture .
what picture ?
i do not know , but i do not like what I am hearing !
look I am very glad that you saved ross from the car backfire , but y'know , it could have been a bullet and you y'know , you did not try to save me !
ohh , you are upset because you think i chose ross over you !
no !
i knew you could take care of yourself .
y'know , i mean ross , he need help .
he is not street like us !
when it comes down to it , you would risk your life for ross before you would for me .
that is the bottom line .
well , no , not exactly !
all right , look , i , i was not trying to save ross .
okay ?
my sandwich was next to ross .
all right ?
i was , i was trying to save my sandwich .
from a bullet !
i know it does not make much sense  much sense ?
!
look chandler , it was instinct !
okay ?
i just went for it !
so you risked your life , for a sandwich !
i know it sounds crazy , but chandler this is  the greatest sandwich in the world !
so you did not uh , choose ross before me .
no !
i would never do that !
you you are like my brother !
really ?
!
yeah !
in fact , to prove how much you mean to me ,  here .
thanks .
no , eh , oh oi , easy , it is not a hot dog !
how good is that ?
oh oi ho , yeah !
see ?
hm hmm .
oh whoa hey , dude , what are you doing ?
!
i thought you were showing me how much you mean to me .
yeah .
with a bite !
gee e e eez !
hey !
hi !
rach , what uh , what are you doing here ?
hey !
y'know what ?
you are in our apartment all the time !
okay ?
this is , this is just a drop in the bucket mister !
y'know , it it does not matter .
the important thing is that you are here .
you are my friend , and you are here .
oh !
okay , just a little scared .
what is going on ross ?
the most amazing thing happened tonight .
i thought my number was up .
i had an actual near death experience !
what ?
!
what ?
what happened ?
!
okay , okay , we were on the ride along with gary , right ?
yeah !
and somebody took a shot at me !
really ?
!
no , a car backfired , but  i thought somebody was taking a shot at me .
and rach , i i survived !
and i was filled with this this great respect for life .
y'know ?
i i want to experience every moment .
i want to seize every opportunity .
i i am seeing everything so so clearly now .
because a car backfired ?
okay , why are you here ?
well , i i i do not know how this fits into your whole seizing  thing but um , emily called you today .
you talked to her ?
no , she left a message .
but it it kind of got erased .
there is just  something wrong with your machine .
well , okay , what what did she say ?
well , uh something about having second thoughts about the wedding and did you guys make a mistake breaking up and uh , she wants you to call her .
wow !
now , that that was a good thing that i told you , right ?
huh ?
yeah !
yes , of course !
okay .
thank you !
thank you !
because I am sorry , all right .
because y'know what ?
she did not want me not important .
the point is , i was right .
your decision .
okay ?
i was right .
your decision .
right .
i guess , i guess i should call emily .
okay , no , that is not the right decision .
that is not , that is not right , no ross ross , come on !
i mean , that woman made you miserable !
okay , ross , do you really want to get back into that ?
okay , look , yesterday i would have even considered calling her back , but my ex wife calls on the same day i have a near death experience .
i mean , that that has got to mean something !
ugh , ross !
that was not a near death experience !
that was barely an experience !
you were not there !
okay , maybe this is something that i I am supposed to seize !
y'know ?
okay , y'know what ?
maybe , this is not about seizing stuff .
maybe this is about escaping stuff .
huh .
i mean , look look today you escaped   death , y'know ?
and maybe this is a chance for you to escape getting back together with emily ?
that does make sense .
because i do want to seize some opportunity , but i i really do not want to see or talk to her .
well , there you go !
yeah .
maybe today is just , close call day .
close call day .
hey , thanks rach .
ohh , honey no problem .
okay .
oh wait wait wait !
the message is blinking .
maybe you did not erase it .
oh ?
hey ross , it is you !
oh yeah , no that is that is an old message , nobody needs to hear that .
no .
hey umm , was was monica here ?
yeah .
yeah , i want my money back .
yeah , uh you you probably need that for stamps , right ?
hey pheebs , has gary ever been shot at for real ?
yes .
once .
yeah , a little .
he kind of did it to himself .
it is not really a good story .
i wonder how i would react under fire , y'know ?
and not backfire but but heavy fire , like i was in a war or something .
man , i would be great in a war !
i mean , i really , i think i would make a fantastic military leader .
i mean i know i would make general way before any of you guys .
before or after you were shot by your own troops ?
i know where joey would be .
he would be down in the foxhole protecting all of us .
yes , if the foxhole was lined with sandwiches .
yeah , hero sandwiches .
well you all know that I am a pacifist so I am not interested in war in any way .
but y'know what ?
when the revolution comes , i will have to destroy you all .
not you joey .
hey !
i just got uh , my teacher evaluations !
check out what this one student wrote , i loved dr .
geller s class .
mind blowing lectures !
dr .
geller , you are definitely the hottie of the paleontology department !
ahh , hotties of the paleontology department , there s a big selling calendar , eh ?
who wrote it ?
oh , i wish i knew , but the evaluations are all anonymous .
oh hey , do you still have their final exams ?
yeah .
oh ,  because you can just match the evaluation to the exam with the same handwriting and boom , there s your admirer .
a hot girl s at stake and all of the sudden he s rain man .
okay , wait a minute , wait a minute , why are we so sure that this is a girl ?
it s a girl !
anyway , it wou it wouldn t matter .
okay ?
because i m a teacher and she s a student .
oh , is that against the rules ?
no , but it is frowned upon .
i see .
besides , there s a big age difference .
oh , well think of it like this , when you re 90  i know when i m 90 she ll be like 80 and it won t seem like such a big difference .
no that s not what i was going to say at all .
no , what i was going to say is when you re 90 you ll still have the memory of what it was like to be with a 20 year old .
hey chandler !
y know that girl you went to college with who who became a movie director ?
oh yeah , dana keystone .
she was in my movement class .
what s a movement class ?
it s chandler s way of pretending he didn t take mime .
oh well listen , anyway she s directing the new al pacino movie .
you got to get me an audition !
oh , i don t know man .
i haven t talked to her in like ten years .
no no no , please please chandler i i i would owe you so much !
you do owe me so much .
you owe me three thousand , four hundred  hey hey dude , why are you changing the subject ?

wow !
i can t believe you lied to me .
okay , i can fix this !
okay monica , rachel thinks all you can talk about is the wedding .
great !
well rachel , the reason why i won t let you drive the porsche is because you re a terrible driver .
there !
that wasn t about the wedding .
look rach if if you want to go for a ride in the porsche i ll be glad to take you for a quick spin around the block .
yeah , you got a couple hours ?
whew !
that was a brisk ride !
take the top down did ya ?
only way to fly .
come on ross give me the keys !
monica does not know what she s talking about !
i am an excellent driver !
you re fast and irresponsible .
that adds up to a bad driver .
well in high school , that added up to head cheerleader .
did you see the look that girl just gave me ?
huh ?
she must ve seen me cruising in the bad boy .
i think she s checking out your beehive ross .
what ?
!
give give me a brush .
give me the keys !
no way !
well no brush !
fine !
y know what ?
it doesn t matter , because , if i remember correctly , there is a comb on the floor of the bathroom .
alimony .
chandler , we still haven t gotten an rsvp from your dad .
oh !
right .
umm , maybe that s because i didn t send him an invitation .
chandler !
he s your father ; he should be at the wedding .
i don t even know the man .
okay ?
we re not the close .
i haven t seen him in years .
well what are you going to do when he finds out he wasn t even asked ?
!
well he doesn t have to know !
it s not like we run in the same circles .
i hang out with you guys , and he stars in a drag show in vegas .
ooh , i think i want to trade circles .
trust me , you don t want him there either .
okay ?
nobody is going to be staring at the bride when the father of the groom is wearing a back less dress .
so what !
as long as he s not wearing a white dress and a veil i don t care .
okay , i think i need to do some shopping .
ahhh !
ooh , nice !
my god !
what do you think you re doing ?
!
just washing the windshield .
there is no way i am letting you drive this car !
so why don t you just hand over the keys ?
oh .
no ah ah ah !
do not start this car !
okay !
okay !
i will give you twenty bucks if you get out of this car right now !
look ross , if you re so freaked out , just get in the car !
with you ?

we re not eloping .
i love the flowers .
can our wedding be bigger please ?
we re going to las vegas to see your dad .
it s time you two talked , and i want to get to know my father in law .
y know we already went over this and i won !
no you didn t .
oh and honey just so you know , now that you re marrying me , you don t get to win anymore .
look forget it okay ?
i don t want to go .
i don t want to see him .
i don t want to .
chandler , look i i know that your dad embarrassed you .
i know  no no all kids are embarrassed by their parents , you d have to come up with a whole new word for what i went through .
when i was in high school , he used to come to all of my swim meets dressed as a different hollywood starlet .
y know it s hard enough to be fourteen .
you re skinny .
you re wearing speedoes that your mom promised that you would grow into !
and you look up into the stands and there s your dad cheering you on dressed as carmen miranda .
we was wearing a headdress with real fruit that he will later hand out to your friends as a healthy snack !
hey , the point is that he was at everyone of your swim meets and he was there cheering you on !
okay ?
that s a , that s a pretty great dad .
he had sex with mr .
girabaldi !
who s mr .
girabaldi ?
does it matter ?
!
chandler , you re not fourteen anymore .
okay ?
maybe it s time that you let that stuff go .
if your father s not at your wedding you re going to regret it for the rest of your life .
yeah of okay , but i m just doing this for you .
yes !
so i really never get to win anymore ?
how much did ever really win before ?
pheebs !
hey !
listen , you know how uh , when you re wearing pants and you lean forward i check out your underwear ?
yeah !
well , when jake did it i saw that he was wearing women s underwear !
i know .
they were mine .
oh .
no !
no wait , that s weird !
no , it s not !
we were just goofing around and i dared him to try them on .
that s weird !
i m wearing his briefs right now .
that s kind of hot .
i think so too .
and that little flap ?
great for holding my lipstick .
yeah , i wouldn t know about that .
and !
y know what jake says ?
that women s underwear is actually more comfortable .
and he loves the way the silk feels against his skin .
yeah well next thing you know , he ll be telling you that your high heels are good for his posture !
there is nothing wrong with jake !
okay ?
he is all man !
i m thinking even more than you .
oh yeah , he looked like a real lumberjack in those pink laceys .
i m just saying that only a man completely secure with his masculinity could walk around in women s underwear !
i don t think you could ever do that .
hey !
i am secure with my masculinity .
okay whatever .
you ve seen my huge stack of porn right ?
god .
i forgot how much i love driving .
i have got to get my license renewed .
you don t have a valid driver s license okay that is it !
pull over right now !
oh ross you re so tense !
you just got to relax okay ?
just need to relax all right ?

i don t want him to know we re yet !
i m not sure i m ready for that .
and besides he s not going to be too happy to see me either .
why not ?
!
i don t know if i ve told you this , but he s kind of tried to get in contact with me a lot over the last few years what ?
!
yeah , he s made phone calls , written letters , he even came to new york , but i always said i was too busy to see him .

my friend marjorie is playing the steel drums .

ah , well then there are going to be a few surprises !
i can not believe we are going to be the only people that are not in this wedding .
i know , i hate being left out of things .

strike two !
strike three !
you only get one more , mike !
so , what did you decide ?
i decided to pee .
mike did not tell you ?
you have to chose one of us to be in your wedding .
one of his groomsmen fell out .
oh no , no .
i can not choose between you two !
i love you both so much !
just not enough to put us in the original wedding party .
oh , i do not want to choose !
it is  .
oh okay , wait .
rach !
listen i have a very special bridesmaid task for you today .
goody , what is it !
well , there is a spot open for only one groomsman and you have to choose between ross and chandler .
so good luck with that .
what , what , what , no , i do not want to do that .
all right , i guess I will have to find a new bridesmaid .
I will do it !
ok , it is 2100 hours .
time for your toast .
you had a bathroom break at 2030 .
pee on your own time , mike !
.
now , in regard to the toast , okay , you want to keep them short , nothing kills a rehearsal dinner like long speeches .
okay .
you just get in , do your thing and get out !
it is 2101 and i am not amused .
.
ok , the bride and groom have a few words they would like to say .
ok .
hello everyone and thank you all for being here tonight .
so tomorrow's the big event and some of you might not know , but mike and i did not get off to the best start .
.
my friend joey and i decided to fix each other up with friends so i , i .
.
.
oh i .
.
.
hum .
.
.
i gave it a lot of thought and i fixed him up with my friend mary ellen who could not be here tonight because .
.
.
it is not important .
.
.
she is in rehab .
anyway , so , ok , joey said that he was fixing me up with his friend mike , only he did not have a friend mike so he just brought , uhm , my mike and , and  but despite , you know .
.
.
it got .
.
.
it got good .
ok , i want to take a moment to mention my mother , who could not be here .
.
.
and .
.
.
moment's over !
so , ok , uh , i can forget that .
i can forget that and uhm .
.
.
oh this is funny !
oh , but you need to know that to .
.
.
that , to .
.
.
oh , ok , well , uhm , i  .
ok , ok , i , ok , i .
.
.
.
monica i can not do it like this !
this is my wedding !
okay , i do not want this  or this  or this  ok ?
i just wanted a simple wedding !
where my fiancee can go to the bathroom anytime he wants !
you know what ?
you are done .
what ?
you are fired !
cheers !
hey !
happy wedding day !
oh , happy my wedding day to you !
ok dokey , joey , listen .
this is going to be bridesmaid central , all right ?
we are going to have hair and make up going on in the bathroom and oh , i had to move a couple of things in the fridge to make room for the corsages .
oh , man !
i would not have had breakfast if i knew there was going to be corsages !
hi .
about last night .
.
.
i know you are under a lot of stress and even though the things you said hurt me a little bit .
.
.
my point is , uh , well , I am willing to take my job back .
oh , well that is ok .
i think you and i will do much better if you are just .
.
.
here as a bridesmaid .
oh , is that so ?
ok .
if that is really what you want , then here .
.
.
i give you the headset .
well , i do not really want to give you the headset .
well i guess if you are taking over , you should probably return these messages .
wow , this is a lot !
uh huh , but I am sure you can handle this .
i mean , i have won awards for my organizational skills , but , uh , I am sure you will do fine .
you won awards ?
mm mh .
i printed them out on my computer .
hey !
hi .
where is rach ?
she is in her room , why ?
i have to talk to her about this groomsman situation , ok ?
I am not going to watch chandler up there while I am sitting in the seats like some chump !
.
oh !
my god !
you are breathtaking !
what d'you want ?
you have not by any chance chosen a groomsman yet , have you ?
oh , ross , c'mon , please !
do not make this harder than it already is !
I am not !
I am making it easier !
pick me !
well , chandler said that it is really important to him too !
listen , listen .
whoever you pick is going to walk down the aisle with you !
now , i promise i will not say a word , but if you pick chandler he is going to be whispering stupid jokes in your ear the whole time !
oh , you are the lesser of two evils !
yes , yes !
sven i do not understand what you are saying !
what is wrong with the flowers ?
lorkins ?
what the hell are lorkins ?
i know .
listen , mike , if you were swedish and you were saying the word lorkins  what flowers would that be ?
right there !
that is why I am marrying you !
hello michael .
may i have a word with you , please ?
have a seat .
last night , i tried to welcome you into my family .
.
.
and instead , you disrespect me .
.
.
i cannot allow this .
more back talk .
and yes , i may be borrowing a few lines from my recent unsuccessful audition for family honor 2 : thissa time itsa personal .
i want you to take this seriously !
phoebe is very very important to me , ok ?
and i want to make sure that you are going to take care of her .
that is what i wanted to hear !
because she is family , ok , and now you are going to be family , and there is nothing more important in the whole world , than family .
that was me !
hi hey , can i talk to you about this groomsman thing ?
if you pick ross , he will walk you down the isle just fine .
but if you choose me , you will be getting some comedy !
even so , i think I am going to pick ross .
let me tell you why you need to pick me .
see , when i was a kid , i was always left out of everything , you know , and it really made me feel .
.
.
insecure .
you know , i was always picked last in gym .
even behind that big fat exchange student who did not even know the rules to baseball .
i mean , this guy would strike out and then run to third .
anyway , if I am the only one left out of this wedding , i just know that all those feelings are going to come rushing back .
all right fine , i pick you .
y y yeeesss !
make groom  for chandler .
oh my .
.
.
no !
we are going to do it my way .
because your way is stupid !
alright i got to go , i have another call , reverend .
hello ?
I am glad we had this little talk .
okay .
bye .
oh my god , what is it doing here ?
ugh , i guess it got sent to the billing address as opposed to the shipping address .
uh !
what a pickle .
oh my god , everything is such a mess .
why is this happening to me ?
how bad do you want to stick your tongue on that ?
how is it going ?
good .
I am just getting some coffee .
so I am alert for the wedding .
that is what i was doing too .
well , you have fun tonight .
you too .
oh , i will .
me too .
wait a minute , i know why I am being such an ass , why are you ?
I am not supposed to tell you .
I am not supposed to tell you !
you told us both we could be in the wedding ?
well , in my defense , you were not supposed to tell each other .
rachel , only one of us can do it , you have to choose .
you and me together again .
rach , rach , knock knock .
who is there ?
I will tell you at the wedding .
uh .
you know what , i can not do this .
i do not know which one of you guys to pick .
what ?
a dog ?
no !
rachel gets to choose .
wow , this is a tough one .
i think I am going to have to go with the dog .
alright , wait , so what you are saying is that the chef is at the hamilton club , but the food is not and the drinks are there , but the bartender is not ?
are you , are you freaking kidding me !
?
how is it going ?
help me .
what ?
i want you to be crazy bitch again .
really ?
please ?
you really want me to come back ?
more than i want to get married .
ok people , we are back in business !
oh god , we have missed you soo much !
ok , go and get your hair and make up done , and I will take care of everything .
hey , what are you guys going to do ?
about what ?
the blizzard .
i just saw on the news , it is like the worst snow storm in 20 years !
they already closed all the bridges and tunnels .
ooh !
but the band and the photographer are coming all the way in from new jersey !
i do not think they are .
haha !
looks like you are not going to be in the wedding either .
so sorry pheebs .
well , the club lost it is power .
yeah according to the news , most of the city did .
since when do you watch the news ?
uh , for your information , since they hired a very hot weather girl .
i can not believe you guys are not going to be able to get married today .
i know .
wow , you know , it is so beautiful out there .
you always wanted to get married outside .
why do not you guys just do it on the street ?
what ?
well , look , it is hardly snowing anymore .
i mean you could not ask for a more romantic setting .
this could be the simple wedding you have always wanted !
what do you think ?
me too !
monica , do you think we could do it ?
affirmative !
ok let us get these chairs out here !
gunther , hit the christmas lights .
okay , who left the ice sculpture  on the steam grate ?
so technically , would this person be in the wedding ?
no , but chandler , hello .
.
.
are not you scared of dogs ?
I am not scared .
I will just take little chappy and .
.
.
he can sense my fear .
my throat is exposed .
well , i guess I am in the wedding then .
ha haaa .
.
.
he stinks !
level 1 alert .
i repeat , level 1 .
this is not a drill .
okay we have got a situation .
the minister just called .
he is snowed in .
he can not make it .
oh hey , do not worry .
I am still ordained from your wedding .
really ?
yeah , you would think I would give up being a minister and start paying to ride the subway ?
huhuh .
.
.
uhm , ministers do not ride the subway for free .
i had to read the bible pretty carefully , but .
.
.
yeah we do .
okay , if joey does the ceremony , then we have to find someone else to walk phoebe down the isle .
I will do it .
I will .
.
.

.
.
ah ah .

phoebe and mike are perfect for each other .
and i know i speak for every one here .
.
.
when i wish them a lifetime of happiness .
who has the rings ?
okay .
.
.
when i was growing up , i did not have a normal mom and dad , or a regular family like everybody else , and i always knew that something was missing .
but now I am standing here today , knowing that i have everything I am ever going to need .
.
.
you are my family .
oh wait , oh i forgot .
.
.
and uhm .
.
.
i love you .
.
.
and you have nice eyes .
uh joey .
.

chappy's heart rate has slowed way down .
oh , okay .
phoebe , do you take this man to be your husband ?
i do .
mike , do you take this woman to be your wife ?
i now pronounce you .
.
.
husband and wife .
i got married !
could someone get me a coat , I am freaking freezing .
that really was an incredible wedding .
it was , yeah .
i kind of do not want it to end .
hey , you want to come in for a drink and a bite of corsage ?
I would love to , but it is 2300 hours and I am about to have the most organized sex anyone's ever had .

oh hey , what about ross ?

hey !

the old condom ring in the leather just doesn t say  cool  anymore .
rachel !

oh yeah , i know , but the garbage was full .

okay , i m sorry .
god !
if you re going to cry about it !
(she grabs the box and goes to through it out . ]
whoa whoa , treeger made you cry ?
yes !
and he said really mean things that were only partly true .
i m going to go down there and teach that guy a lesson .
joey , please don t do that .
i think it s best that we just forget about it .
that s easy for you to say , you weren t almost just killed .
all right that s it , school is in session !
my god !
is this a gym card ?
oh yeah , gym member .
i try to go four times a week , but i ve missed the last 1200 times .
so why don t you quit ?
you don t think i ve tried ?
you think i like having 50 dollars taken out of my bank account every month ?
no , they make you go all the way down there !
then they use all of these phrases and peppiness to try and confuse you !
then they bring out maria .
who is maria ?
oh maria .
you can t say no to her , she s like this lycra spandex covered gym treat .
you need me to go down there with you and hold your hand ?
no !
so you re strong enough to face her on your own ?
oh no , you ll have to come .
hey !
you hold on pal !
now you made my friend , rachel , cry .
so now , you re going to go up there and apologize to her , unless you want me to call the landlord .
have you heard about a little something called , not making girls cry .
i have actually not heard of that .
why don t you tell me something i don t know !
oh please , somebody tell me i don t have to go to work today !
what s the matter ?
oh , my first massage today is this incredibly gorgeous guy , and every time i see him i just want to do things to him that i m not allowed to charge for .
so do them for free .
oh no , it is forbidden !
no no , mrs .
potter fires people for fooling around with clients .
and it s against my oath as a masseuse .
they make you take an oath ?
no , i made myself take an oath .
yeah , no fooling around with clients and umm , always be prepared .
yeah , that one s actually from the boy scouts , but it just makes good sense .
why don t you just give him to somebody else ?
no , i can handle it .
no , i m a professional .
oh pheebs , is that a new ankle bracelet ?
wow !
and you got a petticure .
your feet are all dressed up .
because that s the only part of you he can see when he s on the table !

i don t what your talking about .
then how do you explain the toe ring ?
!
because it s arabian princess day at work !
okay ?

leave me alone !
oh !
my hero !
what happened ?
well uh , i went down there and told him that no one treats my friends like that and that he d better come up here and apologize .
i ll see you later .
what a minute , what did he say ?
he said that he wasn t going to apologize because you guys are living here illegally , so instead what he s going to do is have you evicted i ll see you later .
what ?
!
you got us evicted !
!
i told you not to go down there !
well he made rachel cry !
rachel always cries !
that s not true !

i ll try !
but if i can t , you can stay with chandler and i until you get settled .

all right , all right , all right .
i mean i ll have to check with him first , but i ll think he ll be cool with it .
whoa whoa whoa , hey !
now remember what we talked about , you got to be strong .

and i m not going to be , so you can save you little speech .
these old things .

we re doomed .
okay , they re going to take 50 bucks out of our accounts for the rest of our lives .
what are we going to do ?

now , there s two reasons .
hey .
ohh , you guys , remember that cute client i told you about ?
i bit him .
where ?

she untied his g string with her teeth .
somebody stop me !
i thought we weren t going to have bachelor/bachelorette parties !
y know , we agreed that it was a silly tradition .
it s a grand tradition !
i m sorry , they surprised me .
there was nothing i could do !
well you could ve untied it with your hands .
this is so unfair !
the one thing i wanted to do was throw my best friend a bachelor party , but no , i wasn t allowed to .
all i got was a stupid steak dinner !
you went home with the waitress .
oh yeah , that was a pretty good night .
i can t believe you didn t tell me !
you know that the two pillars of marriage are openness and honesty !
ugh , i knew giving you that book was going to come back and bite me in the ass !
oh , i i don t eat meat .
yeah , i don t eat that either .
well actually umm   in case you didn t notice , that is a scary man .
he s right though , the  74 is absolute piss .
this was such a huge mistake .
i can t tell him phoebe .
i can t , i can t , i can t , i can t  rachel !
no it s okay , this is what s going to happen .
i m going to wait a couple years and then the baby will tell him .
why , so he can get mad at the baby ?
hey , that is the baby s problem .
oh , everything okay with the waiter ?
well  umm , i got tivo .

oh my god !
you are going to love me so much !
i felt really bad about the whole bachelorette party thing , so tonight you re going to have a bachelor party .

i don t want you to get me a stripper  will you let the lady talk ?
!

come on , it ll be fun !
it ll make me feel so much better .
look , i appreciate it , but uh , it s a little creepy .
y know ?
i m not a bachelor anymore .
so don t think of it as a bachelor party , think of it as a a two month anniversary present .
sure , one year is paper , but two months is lapdance !
please !
i feel so bad !
just watch the hot woman get naked !
all right fine !
but i m only doing this for you !
yeah !

i m seeing mona again tonight .
i understand : who would cancel an actual date to go to a fake bachelor party ?
i m sorry i got to cancel tonight baby  i m sorry i won t be able to make it to your imaginary wedding , but i m really busy that day .

wait !
wait !
maybe she s a hooker and a stripper , but she got confused about what she s supposed to do .
could be .
i mean technically she did strip , we just , we just missed it .
ma am , are you also a stripper ?
maybe monica s playing a joke on ya .
y know ?
getting her own husband a hooker , that s pretty funny .
that is funny , maybe for my birthday she ll murder someone .
i bet ross was in on it too .
i mean he was conveniently busy .
oh actually , i d rather you yeah , go ahead .
we re going to have to burn that room down anyway .
i was going to tell you , but  hey !
i did not dump rachel !
nor are we still together .
can i just   why don t we just let the machine get that ?
hey ross .
it s joey .
there s a hooker over here and we thought maybe you d know something about it .
no !
no !
no !

i i i i i need to , i need to lie down .
yeah !
hey !
thanks for getting me that girl s number .
my husband .
she s a stripper .
is that , is that what they call strippers sometimes ?
oh my god stu !
i i can t believe you did this !
now are you absolutely sure she s a hooker ?
maybe she meant to get you a hooker .
why would she do that ?
maybe she wants you to learn something .
huh ?
now is there anything you re really bad at y know , sexually ?
this is the worst bachelor party ever !
in a minute !
in a minute ?
what s going to happen in a minute ?
!

which is why you should do it .
i don t want to .
you do it !
you do it !

you and me used to be inseparable .
y know now it s like things are different .
well y know , things are different .

just over here : i don t want to miss the fight .
ross i m so sorry .

what happened to you two ?
!
thank you so much for coming back over .
i know mona , just hear me out .
first of all , i m so sorry about my father yelling at you , but i heard you totally held your own .
you re going to have to tell me how you did that .
focus .
okay .
um but okay , yes ross and i used to date .
and yes we are going to have a baby .
but we are definitely not getting back together .
oh we just we drove each other crazy !
yeah .
i mean he was possessive , he was jealous , he could never just let the little things go !
trying to date this woman .
right !
but , none of that compared to how kind and and how gentle and thoughtful he is .
probably shouldn t touch me .
i know , i get it , but mona , what relationship is not complicated ?
i mean we all have our baggage !
you must too !
why else would you still be single ?
i am so going to leave right now .
should i leave this open for you too ?
because what s going on with rachel has nothing to do with how i feel about you .
i know and i was going to , but i thought it was better that you heard it from rachel s father .
look i i made a mistake , but it s only because i really , really like you .
really !
forgot my purse !
oh , you guys made up .
he s a good kisser isn t he ?
i m going !
i swear i didn t know she was a hooker !
i mean wh did you let her smoke in here ?
her ass print is still on your grandmother s quilt , do you really want to talk about smoking ?
y know what ?
i m going to make this up to you .
i promised you a stripper  , and you re going to get a stripper .
monica !
wait !
what ?
carry on .
ooh , these tennis shoes are so tight .
i think i ll take them off .
could you not narrate ?
gotcha sailor .
wow , you told your dad the truth .
about an hour ago .
want to go see a movie ?
yes !
bye daddy .
hey !
i do too think about the consequences of my decisions !
what gives you the right to   go to hell !
stupid guy on my phone .
erica , are you okay ?
oh my god !
relax !
we will just get her some antacids .
she does not have a stomach ache .
she is in labor !
oh my god !
so if you think i did not say goodbye to you because you do not mean as much to me as everybody else , you are wrong .
it is because you mean more to me .
rach !
what ?
!
hey .
shh .
.
go back to sleep .
i have to go home .
oh .
this was amazing .
it really was .
you have learned some new moves !
yeah , well , this guy at work gave me sex for dummies  as a joke .
ah .
who is laughing now ?
i know !
breathe , breathe , breathe .
.
.
good .
next time , can i say breathe ?
no , last time you said it like dracula , and it scared her !
can i get you anything ?
you want some more ice chips ?
alright , I will be right back .
where are you going ?
to use the bathroom .
you can not leave me alone with her .
what ?
this is exactly the kind of social situation that i am not comfortable with !
what kind of social situation are you comfortable with ?
it is just that we have never spent any time , you know , alone together .
you will be fine .
nah , you will not , but I will be back in two minutes .
okay .
so , ah .
.
.
any plans for the summer ?
hah .
may not want to mention this .
so , you ever wonder which is worse , you know ; going through labor or getting kicked in the nuts ?
well , it is just interesting .
you know , because no one will ever know , because no one can experience both .
one of life's great , unanswerable questions .
i mean , who knows ?
maybe there is something even more painful than those things ?
like this .
morning .
hey !
what is that ?
it is my house warming present for monica and chandler .
it is a baby chick and duck !
uh huh .
and i named them chick jr .
and duck jr .
i did not see that coming .
yeah , i figure they will love it at the new house , you know ?
it has that big backyard .
and then , when they get old , they can go to that special farm that chandler took the other chick and duck to .
yes .
yeah .
it is a shame people can not visit there .
that is the rule , though .
guess what ?
you are almost an uncle !
what ?
yeah , erica went into labor last night .
monica and chandler are at the hospital right now !
oh my god !
yeah , and i have a definite feeling it is going to be a girl .
phoebe , you were sure ben was going to be a girl .
have you seen him throw a ball ?
is rachel here ?
uh , i think she is still asleep .
hey , hey , how did it go with you guys last night ?
she seemed pretty pissed at you .
uh , we , y'know , we worked things out .
what is that smile ?
did something happen with you two ?
hey , I am not one to kiss and tell , but I am also not one to have sex and shut up .
we totally did it !
oh my god .
you and rachel ?
i know , it is pretty great .
so what does that mean ?
are you guys getting back together ?
oh , i .
.
i do not know .
we did not really get to talk .
but do you want to get back together ?
i do not know .
it was incredible .
i mean , it just felt so right .
when i was holding her , i mean , i never wanted to let her go .
you know what ?
yeah , i do .
i want to be together .
yay !
shhh !
yay !
so , so is she still going to paris ?
wow , i had not thought of that .
i hope not .
oh , this is like the best day ever .
ever !
you guys might get back together , monica and chandler are getting their baby , there are chicks and ducks in the world again !
oh , i feel like I am in a musical !
daa    raa .
.
.
when the sun comes up , bright and beaming !
and the moon comes .
.
.
morning !
guess we will never know how it ends .
okay .
hey .
hey .
hey .
how did you sleep ?
good .
you ?
good .
i bet you did !
uh .
would you guys mind giving us a minute ?
sure , yeah .
will you just keep an eye on the chick and the duck ?
chick and the duck ?
did not they die .
.
.
dive .
yeah , they dove head first into fun on the farm .
so .
.
.
morning .
you too .
last night was just wonderful .
it really was .
i woke up today with the biggest smile on my face .
i know , me too .
it was .
.
.
you know , it was like one of those things you think is never going to happen , and then it does , and it is everything you want it to be .
uh huh .
i know .
it was just , it was just the perfect way to say goodbye .
it is just a little bit more , honey .
is it really that bad ?
oh !
oh my god !
that is the most beautiful top of a head i have ever seen !
chandler , you have to see this !
I am okay .
chandler , you do not want to miss this .
this is the birth of your child !
it is the miracle of life !
alright .
wow , that is one disgusting miracle .
it is a .
.
.
it is a boy !
wow !
oh , you did it !
it is a baby !
a beautiful little baby !
and some other stuff I am going to pretend i do not see .
well , that is spongy .
oh , hey handsome !
oh , I am going to love you so much that no woman is ever going to be good enough for you !
oh , we are so lucky !
i know .
he has your eyes .
i mean , i know that is not possible , but he does .
okay .
oh my god , he is beautiful .
thank you so much .
how do you feel ?
i .
.
.
I am sorry , who should be along in a what now ?
we only ordered one !
oh , yeah !
these are the faces of two people in the know !
well , gosh .
that makes me feel so special and good .
wait , did you know it was twins ?
anybody tell you ?
this is unbelievable .
interesting !
can i see you for a second ?
what do we do ?
what do you mean what do we do  ?
twins !
twins !
!
chandler , you are panicking !
uh huh !
join me , will not you ?
!
okay , what do you say we keep one , and then just like have an option on the other one ?
we can not split them up !
why not ?
we could give each of them half a medallion , and then years later , they will find each other and be reunited .
i mean , that is a great day for everybody .
okay , what if the person who adopts the other one is horrible ?
what if they are not ?
what if it is adopted by a king ?
yeah , because i hear the king is looking to adopt .
monica , we are not ready to have two babies !
that does not matter !
we have waited so long for this .
i do not care if it is two babies .
i do not care if it is three babies !
i do not care if the entire cast of eight is enough  comes out of there !
we are taking them home , because they are our children !
okay .
shhh .
.
.
okay .
okay !
okay !
she ?
it is a girl ?
well , now we have one of each !
and that is enough !
and then she said it was the perfect way to say goodbye .
oh my god !
what did you say ?
nothing !
what do you say to that ?
ross , you have got to tell her how you feel !
no way !
you can not just give up !
is that what a dinosaur would do ?
what ?
dude , I am just trying to speak your language .
ross , rachel does not know that you want to get back together .
if she did , she might feel differently .
she might not even go .
you really think so ?
I am telling you !
oh , okay !
this is the part of the musical where there would be a really good convincing song .
bam bam , do not take no for an answer .
bam bam , do not let love fly away .
bam bam bam bam .
.
.
hi !
can not a girl finish a song around here ?
hey !
hi !
so i just dropped emma off at my mom's .
okay .
oh , you are not taking her with you tonight ?
no , we decided that i would go ahead and set up first , and then my mom would bring emma to paris on sunday .
wow , eight hour flight with a one year old ?
good luck , mom .
are you kidding ?
eight hours with my mother talking about atkins ?
good luck , emma !
alright , you know what ?
you are right .
i should at least tell her how i feel .
ross , wait !
what ?
what ?
could you get me a muffin ?
yeah ?
gunther .
.
.
oh .
.
.
i love you too .
probably not in the same way , but i do .
and , and when I am in a caf  , having coffee , or i see a man with hair brighter than the sun , I will think of you .
aw .
oh .
.
.
bye guys .
oh my god !
unbelievable !
hey , you know what might help ?
I am not getting you a muffin !
do you think they recognize each other from in there ?
maybe .
unless they are like two people who have lived in apartments next to each other for years , and then one day they are pushed through a vagina and they meet .
there is something that we want to tell you .
we decided to name the girl baby erica .
son of a gun , it is !
okay , well , bye !
bye !
we will call you !
have fun at church camp !
oh , look at these little bunnies !
i know !
you ready to trade ?
okay .
okay .
alright , let us see .
.
we could trade later .
yeah , I am good .
hey , what are you working on ?
it is a .
.
.
it is a welcome home  sign for the baby .
how sweet !
oh , is that the baby ?
no , i sat in the paint .
hey .
hey .
so , did you talk to rachel ?
no , and I am not going to .
what ?
why not ?
because she is just going to shoot me down .
you guys saw what happened with gunther .
that did not look like fun .
how can you compare yourself to gunther ?
i mean , sure , he is sexy in a more obvious way .
you have a relationship with her , you slept together last night .
yeah , and she still wants to go !
it is pretty clear where she is .
yeah , i know what you mean .
i mean , sometimes .
.
.
uh , joe ?
damn it !
look , even if i were going to tell her , i do not have to do it now .
okay ?
I will be seeing her again .
we have got time .
no , you do not !
she is going to paris !
she is going to meet somebody .
do you know how many hot guys there are in paris ?
it is .
.
.
it is a city of gunthers !
hey !

i have to catch my stupid plane .
i want to see the baby !
monica just called from the cab .
she said they should be here any minute .
and apparently , there is some big surprise .
yeah , did she sound happy about it ?
because my friend ethel's baby was born with a teeny , tiny beard .
oh my god !
oh my god !
hi !
oh my gosh !
hey .
hey , so what is the big surprise ?
oh .
oh my god !

now , what , what kinds are they ?
this is a boy ,  and that is a girl .
her name is erica .
aw .
.
hey , that pregnant girl's name was erica .
yeah .
it is a shame you two did not get to spend more time together .
yeah , we named the boy jack after dad .
aw , he is going to be so happy .
oh , jack bing .
i love that .
ooh , it sounds like a '40s newspaper guy , you know ?
jack bing , morning gazette .
I am going to blow this story wide open !
oh my gosh .
wow , so beautiful .
oh yeah ?
well , tell me which one , and I will try slip it in my coat .
one ?
how about a whole bunch ?
yeah !
ooh , we could teach them to sing , and we can be like the von trapp family !
only without the nazis .
although that sounds kind of dull .
oh , you guys , i can not believe this .
but I will leave now , or I am going to miss my plane .
I am just so glad you got to see the babies .
me too .
oh , I am just sorry I am not going to be around to watch you two attempt to handle this !

so , you just let her go ?
yeah .
hey , maybe that is for the best .
yeah ?
yeah .
you know ?
you just .
.
.
look , you got to .
.
.
you got to think about last night the way she does , okay ?
maybe , maybe sleeping together was the perfect way to say goodbye ?
but now she will never know how he feels !
maybe that is okay .
you know ?
maybe , maybe it is better this way ?
i mean , now , now you can move on .
i mean , you have been trying to for so long , maybe now that you are on different continents .
.
right ?
maybe now you can actually do it .
you know ?
you can finally get over her .
yeah , that is true .
except i do not want to get over her .
what ?
i do not !

not since my cop show got cancelled .
you have to get a ticket to get past security .
what ?
we are never going to make it !
not with that attitude !
now , haul ass !
okay , if you could all walk slower , that would be great .

something is wrong with the left philange .
oh , honey , I am sure there is nothing wrong with the plane .
alright , look , i have to go .
i love you , and i will call you the minute i get to paris .
oh , that was just my crazy friend .
she told me i should get off the plane , because she had a feeling that there was something wrong with the left philange .
i would not worry about it .
she is always coming up with stuff like this , and you know what ?
she is almost never right .
well .
.
.
wait , what are you doing ?
could i get some peanuts ?
this is ridiculous !
i .
.
.
yeah , okay .
alright .
my job here is done .

yeah , they were just slowing me down .
alright , i have to get back to the babies .
I will see you girls later .
sorry about the table , man .
yeah .

i do not know how much I am going to want to play after you go .
well , at least we got these little guys out .
yeah .
aww , we were worried about you !
hm .
i guess i better get used to things crapping in my hand , huh ?
I am going to miss these little guys .
it was nice having birds around again .
hey , you know what ?
maybe we should keep them here with you .
what ?
yeah , i mean we have got a lot going on right now .
and , plus , here they would have their own room .
i could get a goose !
you know , i    i think you are set with the poultry .
thanks man .
did you hear that , you guys ?
you are going to get to stay here !
and , and it is good , you know , because , because now you have a reason to come visit .
i think there may be another reason .
so , awkward hug or lame cool guy handshake ?
uh , lame cool guy handshake , yeah .

where is ross ?
he went home .
he did not want to see anybody .
ross , hi .
it is me .
i just got back on the plane .
and i just feel awful .
that is so not how i wanted things to end with us .
it is just that i was not expecting to see you , and all of a sudden you are there and saying these things .
.
.
and .
.
.
and now I am just sitting here and thinking of all the stuff i should have said , and i did not .
i mean , i did not even get to tell you that i love you too .
because of course i do .
i love you .
i love you .
i love you .
what am i doing ?
i love you !
oh , I have got to see you .
I have got to get off this plane .
oh my god !
excuse me ?
I am sorry .
I am really sorry , but i need to get off the plane , okay ?
i need to tell someone that i love love them .
let her off the plane !
oh , please , miss , you do not understand !
try to understand !
oh , come on , miss , is not there any way that you can just let me off .
.
.

oh my god .
did she get off the plane ?
did she get off the plane ?
i got off the plane .
you got off the plane .
i do love you .
i love you too , and I am never letting you go again .
okay .
because this is where i want to be , okay ?
no more messing around .
i do not want to mess this up again .
me neither , okay ?
we are    we are done being stupid .
okay .
you and me , alright ?
this is it .
this is it .
unless we are on a break .
do not make jokes now .
okay , please be careful with that .
it was my grandmother's .
be careful .
if that falls off the truck , it would not be the worst thing .
wow .
i know .
it seems smaller somehow .
has it always been purple ?
look around , you guys .
this was your first home .
and it was a happy place , filled with love and laughter .
but more important , because of rent control , it was a friggin ' steal !
hey , do you realise that at one time or another we all lived in this apartment ?
oh , yeah , that is true .
uh , i have not .
wait a minute .
what about that summer during college that you lived with grandma , and you tried to make it as a dancer ?
do you realise we almost made it ten years without that coming up ?
oh , honey , i forgot .
i promised treeger that we would leave our keys .
oh , okay .
so , i guess this is it .
yeah .
i guess so .
this is harder than i thought it would be .
oh , it is going to be okay .
do you guys have to go to the new house right away , or do you have some time ?
we got some time .
okay , should we get some coffee ?
sure .
where ?
okay .
hey .
umm .
does everybody hate these shoes ?
oh yeah , but do not worry .
i do not think anybody's going to focus on that as long as your wearing that towel dress .
tell him .
it is her first day at this new job .
your not supposed to start with her !
all right , i suppose i can wait a day .
hey , what are you doing friday ?
why ?
i need you to come to this bachelor party for my weird cousin albert , y'know he is the botanist .
oh god .
y'know , botanists are such geeks .
yeah .
is that a dinosaur tie ?
hmm ?
oh , yeah .
morning .
rach , I am here with the purses !
it must take you forever to find your keys .
thank you , thank you , thank you , pheebs .
your welcome , oh please not the one with the turtles .
no , no , no , no turtles scare me .
i do not need that today .
honey , just relax , it is going to be fine .
hey , umm , .
why do not i come down there and I will take you out to lunch ?
oh honey , thank you , but mark's taking me out .
mark is that ah , the same mark that helped you get the job ?
yeah , it is kind of like a 'good luck on your first day ' sort of thing .
is this actually a lunchbox ?
umm , no , it is a purse .
and there is a thermos in it .
oh .
hey , so can you make it on friday ?
what ?
oh yeah , yeah i think so .
why am i invited to this again ?
well apparently albert has no friends .
he is very excited about the bachelor party though .
i think actually the only reason he is getting married is so he can see a stripper .
a stripper at a bachelor party , that is so clich  .
why do not you get a magician ?
!
well , if the magician can open my beer with his but cheeks , then all right .
she is having lunch with him .
she is having lunch with him .
and you should of seen the hug she gave him when she got the job .
and , and , and ,  he is really good looking .
what am i going to do ?
do not do anything .
keep it inside .
learn how to hide your feelings !
do not cry outloud .
yes !
guess who is in an audition for a broadway musical ?
i want to say you but , that seems like such an easy answer .

joe sensitive , and she starts thinking 'maybe this is the guy for me , because he understands me . '
and before you know it , she is with him .
and you will be all , 'ohh , man ! '
and he will be all , 'yes ! '
and us , we will be like , 'wh whoa , dude . '
and pretty soon you will be like ,  'hhiii , ' and , and , and , 'i can not go , rachel and mark might be there . '

hi rach .

what do you mean ?
remember how you said you were really dense about poetry ?
oh .
so !
I am just an empty vase , huh ?
y'know , so i do not read as many important books as you do , and i do not write trick poems that seem to be about one thing but are actually about something else .
and y'know what , i get excited about stupid stuff , like when i my people magazine comes on saturday , and the new hold everything catalog .
y'know but that does not mean that I am empty , i care about things .
i care about my friends and family .
you have no right to make that kind of judgment about me .
you do not even know me .
.
.
what ?
I am sorry , my friend phoebe .
.
.
oh yeah .
i know , it was the best i could get out of them .
people , people , people .

she is a business woman , she is walking down the street , she is window shopping , and  whoa whoa whoa , sh she is naked !
hi .
hello .
y'know what , I am , I am going to spend some alone time with the pen .
I am sorry , i was an idiot .
a big idiot .
a big idiot .
just you have to realize is , this whole mark thing is kind of hard for me .
honey , why is it hard , i mean we have been together for almost a year now ?
well , i was with carol for like eight years and i lost her .
and now if it is possible i think i love you even more .
so , it is hard for me to believe that I am not going to , well that someone else is not going to take you away .
honey , that is very sweet , it just seems to me though , that if two people love each other and trust each other , like we do , there is no reason to be jealous .
i got to get going .
bye chandler .
oh , okay ross .
listen , this pen is kind of getting boring , so can you pick me up some porn ?
where ya going ?
oh , I have got to go pick up ben , we have got a play date this afternoon .

no dude , you got to hold your breath until you re ready to answer the question .
this is ridiculous , he s not going to hold his breath   okay , what do you have a fear of if you suffer from this phobia , tris holy cow , that s a big word .
trisc  seriously look at this thing .
chandler , how do you say that ?
let me see that .
this one right here .
triscadecaphobia .
the fear of triscuts !
no !
no , fear of the number 13 .
fear of triscuts ?
it s possible , they have really sharp edges .
all right chandler , you re up .
wait a minute , i i believe i m entitled to use my angel pass for a free turn ?
this game makes no sense !
y know what ?
you re just upset because you re losing .
oh come on ross , i think we re all losers here .
all right .
chandler , you can either spin the wheel or pick a google card .
let me think .
let me think oh !
i don t care .
you you must choose mr .
bing .
either , it makes no difference .
choose , you jackass !
i ll take a card .
okay , you picked the gimmie card !
you get all of ross s points !
what ?
!
this game is kind of fun .
you don t think it s a little crazy that you get all my points just  because you  i don t think the contestants are supposed to speak to each other .
why did you invite my mother ?
!
what ?
she wants to move in with me and ross to help take care of the baby .
for how long ?
eight weeks .
i mean i love my mother , but my god , a long lunch with her is taxing .
i personally would be honored if she wanted to live with me .
she can t hear you .
what ?
you guys , come on !
what am i going to do ?
well , if you don t want your mother to move in with you , just tell her .
you re right .
you re right .
i mean i m about to have a baby , i can tell my mother that i don t want her to just be sleeping on my couch !
oh my god !
she s going to want to sleep in my bed with me .
this cannot happen !
that s right .
that is right , you go over there and tell her you don t want her to live with you .
do not take no for an answer !
okay .
this is great !
now she s going to be mad at rachel !
y know what ?
and i m just going to swoop in there and be like the daughter she never had .
i have new respect for chandler .
all right everybody !
it s time to open the presents !
yes !
yes !
and i think that the first gift that rachel opens should be from the grandmother of the baby , because you re the most important person in this room .
and in the world !
how about you less important people , let s open your presents !
mom that s okay that you didn t get you a gift !
oh yeah .
okay , see mom , the truth is i can do this on my own .

!
oh come of course i know that .
i mean of course you never leave a baby alone !
i mean who would she wouldn t be safe as she would be with me , the baby dummy .

the baby s coming and i don t know what to do .
oh , can i throw up in my diaper genie ?

well what s fun about that ?
you expect me to be the host of a boring game that s just people standing around answering questions ?
let s play bamboozled !

y know what ?
maybe , mrs .
green , it s not absolutely vital that you live with us .

i really do .
i don t know anything .
i m i m sure that s not true .
oh no ?
pheebs ?
monica ?
do i know anything about babies ?
no , not a thing .
it s frightening .
well uh , y know what ?
even if she doesn t know anything , i do !
i have a son .
and his mother and i didn t live together , and whenever he was with me i took care of him all the time , by myself .
yeah .
that s a different issue .
uh , the point is , when the baby comes i will be there to to feed her and bathe her and change her .
and more than that i want to do all those things .
yes !
yes , you re going to be so missed .
well you re going to be a wonderful grandma .
hello ?

i still don t know what the hell i m doing !
oh , come on , every first time mother feels that way .

thank you .
oh .
you re still so funny .
you re so funny .
what do i do ?

you have apologized to her like a million times and she s been nothing but terrible to you .
and don t forget you just threw her daughter a lovely , albeit slightly boring , shower , and she hasn t even thanked you for it .
y know what ?
you re you re right .
yeah i mean if you want to say anything to her , i d tell her off .
really ?
uh huh !
okay !
i will !
mrs .
green ?
mrs .
green !
it is rude to leave a party without saying good bye to the host !
yeah , and and also when someone apologizes to you the decent thing to do is to accept it !
now what i did to you , it wasn t on purpose !
but what you re during to me now is just plain spiteful !
that s right !
maybe it s time you took a good hard look at a mirror young lady old lady lady !
wrap it up , wrap it up , wrap it up  so whenever you re ready to apologize to me , i will forgive you .
good day !
i can t feel my legs !

I am crazy about david , and we are having so much fun together .
why why do i miss mike ?
that is that is going to go away , right ?
i guess , in time .
yeah .
i mean , my feelings for richard are certainly gone .
you just did it again .
chandler , your feelings for chandler are certainly gone !
i would not read too much into it .
david , let me stop you there because i think i see where this is going .
I am not very good at giving advice .
so if you want advice , go to ross , monica , or .
.
.
joey , if the thing you want to advice about is pizza toppings or burning sensation when you pee .
seriously , we are going to do this ?
oh , because his penis was too big .
oh , I am sorry , that is the kind of thing i do .
they broke up because mike did not want to get married .
hey , what if you just let phoebe know you would be open to marriage ?
what ?
i did not mean now .
.
.
well , you are welcome !
glad i could help .
david , I am pretending to read here !
!
yeah !
how you doin ' ?
yeah alright !
hey , hey !
you said you are going to wear a thong , where is the thong ?
you really should have been more clear about that !
hey !
hey !
you are never going to guess who i just saw downstairs !
oh !
ah !
eh .
.
.
britney spears !
?
yeah , she never misses these conferences !
no , i just saw dr .
kenneth schwartz !
yeah .
.
.
what am i going to say to kenneth schwartz ?
you could say : hey kenny , how come you are not britney spears ?
ready to go ?
wha .
.
.
?
you are going to go now ?
i thought we could hang out ?
yeah .
will you wear a thong ?
oh .
.
.
you got yourself a very weird deal !
I am good , i have dinner plans  .
yeah , yeah .
I have got tons of stuff i could do .
I am going to hit the beach , go swimming .
.
.
uh , joe , have you looked outside ?
no , why ?
oh man !
i was not going to swim , i was going to dig a hole !
wow !
that mike thing was interesting !
i do not know what is going to happen with phoebe and david .
i do !
want a hint ?
huh ?
i do   i do  .
ok , I am sensing that this is some kind of word play , because you are pink with barely controlled glee .
david is going to propose to phoebe .
what ?
why ?
be because , we were talking about ways that he could beat mike and i told him that phoebe wanted to get married .
chandler , we have talked about this .
you are not supposed to give people advice !
now could not you just have made some sort of inappropriate joke ?
i did !
a penis one !
look , just so i know , what was so wrong about what i said ?
they have only been going out for a few weeks and phoebe is completely hung up on mike !
she will say no  , david's heart will be broken , it will be too hard for them to recover from and then phoebe will end up alone again .
man , that is some bad advice !
oh !
hey !
thank god you guys are here !
hey !
hey what is going on ?
everything is upside down here !
it rains all day long , nobody watches tv and ross is famous !
alright , i do not want to alarm anybody , but monica's hair is twice as big as it was when we landed !
ok !
when i go places with high humidity , it gets a little extra body , ok ?
!
that is why our honeymoon photos look like me and diana ross !
come on , I will show you guys where to check in   oh , honey , can you make sure we get a king size bed !
oh !
david , get one for us too !
oh , oh , and see if they have a heart shaped one !
and with mirrors on the ceiling !
and make sure our room is not next to theirs  .
ooh !
you guys are so lucky you are here with people , you known it is such a romantic place .
that is all , i just wish i could  share that with a guy .
not joey .
not joey , no , i was just lusting after chandler .
yeah , right !
tonight ?
!
is not an engagement ring supposed to have a diamond ?
oh , there it is !
nice !
monica , can i talk to you for a sec ?
ok !
david is going to propose to phoebe tonight !
see what happens when you give people advice ?
i hope you told him not to ?
that would be advice !
!
ok fine .
I will handle this .
phoebe ?
yeah ?
i need to talk to you .
are you leaving the supremes  ?
wow ?
really ?
that is fantastic !
what are you serious ?
you want to marry him ?
wha .
.
.
what about mike ?
oh , ok , you want me to marry mike ?
alright , well , let us just gag him and handcuff him and force him down the aisle .
i can just see it : mike , do you take phoebe .
.
.
you know , it is every girl's dream !
do you really think marrying someone else is the right answer ?
sure !
look , ok , bottom line : i love mike .
.
.
david !
david .
i love david .
do not look at me that way , roseanne rosannadanna !
by using ct scans and computer imaging we can in a very real way , bring the mesozoic era into the 21st century .
oh and you know what , it will be even better tomorrow , because i will not be constantly interrupted by joey checking to see if they put chocolates on my pillow yet .
.
hey guys !

i can not believe this .
i can not believe this is happening .
i have to give the keynote speech tomorrow !
ok ?
i have to stand up in front of all these people .
what am i going to say ?
i could teach you a speech that i memorized for auditions .
i do not think that your monologue from star wars is going to help me right now , joe !
wha .
.
.
what you really think we can do that ?
hey do not worry about that !
i mean , ross needs you !
and rachel and i will stay and help anyway we can .
ugh .
alright , ok , let us do it .
uhm , i know we start by discussing the shortcomings of carbon dating .
.
.
uhm , and then , then i move on to what is clearly the defining moment of the mesozoic era , the breakup of pangea , hello !
and then , there is the .
.
.
eh .
.
.
there is the overview of the triassic .
oh , oh !
any chance any of this happened in a galaxy far , far away  ?
.
ok , mike , enough is enough , now you love phoebe and she loves you , so you need to get over your whole i never want to get married  thing and step up !
this is monica !
I am phoebe's friend .
listen , phoebe is back with david and he is going to propose to her , and she is going to say yes  but i know she really wants to be with you !
i .
.
.
I am sorry , did you say something ?
i can not hear through all this damned hair !
you do not tell me what to do !
i tell you what to do !

and while I have got you , you have got curly hair .
what do you do in humidity ?
damnit !
well , i hope you are happy !
oooh !

phoebe is going to say yes  to david .
see , that is what happens when you meddle in people's lives !
phoebe is going to say yes  ?
that is , that is great !
no it is not , b'because she is still in love with mike !
and there is not chance that will work ?
no , i called him .
it is not going to happen .
oooooooh !
meddler !
meddler !
well , if you had not meddled to start with , i would not have had to go in there and meddle myself .
now , no matter how much we meddle , we will never be able to un meddle the thing that you meddled up    in the first place !
this vacation sucks !
!
I am so bored !
stupid rain , we .
.
.
we can not do anything .
well , I have brought some books .
we could read .
hey , it has not come to that yet .
hey hey hey !
do not mind if i do !
hey rach , do you feel like going to a convention ?
we can not .
we are not pharmacists !
i know we are not , but  frank medeio and .
.
.
eva trorro .
.
.
womba .
.
.
kate miller ?
kate miller it is .
and .
.
.

.
.

.
.
eh .
.
.
gay .
ok , odd thing to get excited about !
hey !
high five !
my wife had a workout friend she went to the gym with everyday for a year .
she did not get any fitter .
i know !
it is like , if you knew , why did not you tell me , you know ?
i mean , call , or leave a note : hi , i just dropped by to say your wife's gay  and then , you try to make the best of a bad situation , so you float the idea of a threesome ?
me neither .
well , who knew ?
pharmacists are fun .
i know , that old lady at the end was ready to take you home .
not enough pills in the world , rach .
what about you , you are the single one , seen anybody in there you like ?
well , let us see .
there was a really big guy that i was talking to , with the really nice breasts .
.
.
but what about back home , anything going on there ?
anybody you like ?
no .
there it is , you are blushing !
no , I am not blushing , I am sunburnt !
from , you know , the rain .
you like someone .
tell me who it is .
who is it ?
no .
tell me who it is .
joey !
come on who ?
who do you like ?
tell me .
you are not getting away that easy .
who do you like , who ?
joey , come on !
it does not matter , you know , it is not like anything's going to happen .
what ?
why not ?
rach , who can you not get ?
oh !
ok .
ok , you really want to know who it is ?
yeah , who is that ?
do ya ?
yeah .
right , of course .
hey , did you guys finish the speech ?
yep , we got it , we got it .
thank you so much .
alright , hey look , and this is not over , because i really want to know who .
.
.
later !
la .
.
.
yeah .
ok .
see you , bye .
good night .
night .
i can not believe she is going to say yes to david .
she is clearly in love with mike .
you know , it is very hard to take you seriously when you look like that .
oh my god , he is going to do it now .
please , i cannot watch this , let us go .
i think we have some time .
have you ever heard him talk ?
uh , phoebe , uh , i would be honoured , uh .
.
.
spit it out , david !
sure , ok , yeah .
oh my god , mike !
no , mike's here .
it is the humidity !
what are you , what are you doing here ?
you are the most incredible woman I have ever met .
how can i lose you ?
now , i do not actually have a ring .
.
.
i would not brag too much about that thing , big guy .
no !
i love you .
but i never needed a proposal from you .
i just needed to know that we were headed somewhere , you know , that we had a future .
david , I am so sorry , I am sorry .
yeah , i might have said yes , but that would have been wrong .
yes !
because of our meddling !
alright ?
oh , are not this nice ?
it is so quiet , i could just lie here all day .
i know   open your drapes !
open your drapes !
I am so glad we have got adjoining rooms !
the sun is out !
hey !
remember when i had corneas ?
ok listen , you go down to the pool and reserve the chairs , and I will get the magazines and the lotion .
ladies ?
ross's speech is in 45 minutes .
nooo !
damn it !
walls are pretty thin , guys !
then we have to await the data from recent mri scans and dna testing which call into question information gathered from years of simple carbon dating .
look at that woman sitting by the pool getting tan .
.
.
so leathery and wrinkled , I am so jealous !
finally , factoring the profusion of new species recently discovered : gigantosaurus , argentinasaurus .
.
.
not to mention the cold sores .
and that is just the herbivores .
I am not even going to discuss the carnivores , their heads are already too big .
which is ironic considering their stunted cerebral development .
really ?
but all kidding aside , in much the same way that homo ergaster [1 ] is now thought to be a separate species from homo erectus .
.
.
he said erectus  !
no , he really said it .
.
.
.
and while there are certainly vast differences between these mesozoic fossiles and the example of homo erectus .
.
.
erectus ?
homo .
.
.
.
in a very real way we can bring the mesozoic era into the 21st century .
thank you !
oh , thanks guys !
oh !
ok .
.
.
now .
.
.
now we are just holding hands !
all right !
well , uh .
.
.
we are going to hit the beach ?
yeah !
it was really .
.
.
great !
oh , thank you so much !
yeah , and so funny !
oh !
ok !
.
.
.
all right , thanks !
thank you so much , you guys !
oh , i can not tell you how much it means to me that you were here !
ok !
.
.
.
uh .
.
.
excuse me ?
yeah ?
hey !
well .
.
.
?
yeah ?
oh , i can not tell you how great it was to look at the crowd and see your face !
i mean .
.
.
uh , did you know you were  mouthing the words along with me ?
no , it is ok !
made me feel like a rock star !
I would better not found you naked in my hotel room !
look , i took it too far !
i can not believe it is raining again !
oh , it is so unfair !
!
!
well , on the bright side , now you will not have to see all these paleontologists with their shirts off .
not you guys .
you got it going on !
so , what are we going to do today ?
ping pong ?
honey , they have ping pong !
let us play !
i do not think so !
why not ?
because you know how competitive you get and well , i say it is cute , others disagree , and I am lying !
I am not always that bad !
oh , yeah ?
what happened when we played last time ?
i punched you .
.
.
?
and .
.
.
?
.
.
.
phoebe .
.
.
?
.
.
.
and .
.
.
?
i clunked your heads together !
hey !
as soon as it stops raining we have got to go snorkeling !
some kid told me about the sea turtle and , if you blow bubbles in its face , it chases ya !
oh .
.
.
oh , but that is ok , I will find someone else to do it .
.
.
I will do it alone , but .
.
.
i do not know what happens if the sea turtle catches you .
.
.
hey !
do not worry about it !
it was fine !
i ended up having the best time with rachel !
i just felt bad for you , stuck in that room , working on ross's speech .
.
.
oh !
oh , well !
at least we are both having fun !
yeah !
a little bit , yeah .
.
.
yeah .
.
.
i think we do .
.
.
.
.
.
about what ?
c'mon guys , it will be fun !
all right , all right .
.
.
I will play if we do not keep score !
but then how do we know who wins ?
nobody wins !
so , we are just four losers .
.
.
super !
I am not playing with you .
yeah , I am out .
ok !
mike , you do not know , you do not know what you are doing !
she gets crazy !

oh , that is crazy !
no , it is not , we have nothing in common !
.
.
.
yeah , it is true .
i mean , she should be with someone like .
.
.
ross !
you know what i mean , he uses all those big words too !
man , smart people are dull !
what , hey !
ok , rach !
i feel so stupid , you know ?
why .
.
.
why do i keep going after the wrong girls ?
w what are you , what are you talking about ?
oh , c'mon , i mean , there is you , then there is charlie , and it is like .
.
.
what the hell is my problem ?
oh !
ok .
.
.
uh .
.
.
maybe you are not always going after the wrong girl .
.
.
I am telling you , rach , charlie is not right for me !

i just have one question !

i do not know , I am not trying to do anything , it is just , we have such a good time when we are together , you know .
.
.
i mean , are not you just a .
.
.
little curious .
.
.
what that would be like ?
.
.

monica knows .
it is this dumb thing that ross made up `because he was trying to fool our parents .
it is a way of giving the finger , without actually having to give it .
i remember i cried the night you made it up , `because it was the first time that i realized that i was actually cooler than my older brother .

whenever i see a girl in fishnet stockings it reminds me of my father in fishnet stockings .
uhh , no no thanks .
listen , i I am going to grab a beer .
I will be right back .
what was that ?
what ?
kathy was being really nice and you just walked away .
i thought we had a deal .
hey , look , what do you want from me ?
i want you to like her !
but if that is too damned difficult for you , then the least you can do is pretend .
i am pretending .
well then , do it better !
okay , what do you saw i go over there and say how much i like her ?
no no it will be good , i can tell her much I have been thinking about her .
that i have not stopped thinking about her since the moment i met her .
that I am so fantastically , over the top , want to slit my own throat in love with her , that for every minute of every hour of every day i can not believe my own damn bad luck that you met her first !
!
well , that is pretty good .
but you might want to tone it down a little .
hey !
so , uhh , amanda just just dropped me off .
yeah , that is one of the things i love about her , she is .
uh , she is old enough to drive .
so uhh , i guess you are not going to mom and dad's tonight ?
no , sorry .
well where is amanda ?
hey rach , could you get me some cough drops ?
i mean y'know , I am thinking .
you could bring her , and you guys could go up to your old room , and not make out .
ross , cough drops , please ?
at least i know she is not going out with me to get into r rated movies .
why do not you just marry her ?
oh no , wait a minute you can not , I am sorry i forgot , she is not a lesbian .
you see amanda and i have a very special .
.
.
you have nothing !
you are not even going out !
you are her baby sitter !

ohh , that is soo sad .
and what are you laughing at , miss `my keg sucking boyfriend is stealing from me ! '

really .
i mean , that is a typical guy response .
excuse me , do any of you know how to play ?
but you could teach us .

alright , here we go .
we have got salmon roulettes and assorted crudites .
whoa , whoa , whoa , monica , what are you doin ' ?
this is a poker game .

yes , and i get my ya yas from ikea .
you have to put them together yourself , but they cost a little less .
look , rachel , this is poker .
i play to win , alright ?
in order for me to win , other people have to lose .
so if you are going to play poker with me , do not expect me to be a 'nice guy , ' ok ?
because once those cards are dealt .

oh yes , yes , we could play some other game .
.
.
like , uh , i do not know .
.
.
pictionary ?
ha , ha , very funny , very funny .
but i think we would like to give poker another try .
shall we , ladies ?
uh , rach , do you want me to shuffle those ?
no , no , that is ok .
y'know , i think I am going to give it a go .
alright .
alright .
.
.
so , phoebs owes $7.50 , monica , you owe $10 , and rachel , you owe fifteen big ones .
but hey , thanks for teachin ' us cross eyed mary .
you guys , we got to play that at our regular game .
alright , here is my $7.50 .

what ?
oh , i cursed it .
so now bad things will happen to he who spends it .
that is alright , I will take it .
bad things happen to me anyway .
this way i can break  them up with a movie .
well , that just leaves the big green poker machine , who owes fifteen .
.

mmm hmmm .
oh , so typical .
ooo , I am a man .

ooo , i have to win money to exert my power over women .
you know what ?
this is not over .
we will play you again , and we will win , and you will lose , and you will beg , and we will laugh , and we will take every last dime you have , and you will hate yourselves forever .
hmm .
kind of stepped on my point there , mon .
so , you gals want to hand over your money now ?

nina .

she is whooo wewee woo whoo whoo !
in fact , if you asked her right now , she would have no recollection of being fired at all , none at all .
and yet , believable .
so i decided not to fire her again until i can be assured that she will be no threat to herself , or others .

helen , could you make sure we put through the paperwork on miss bookbinder s raise ?
helen drinks .

when i was eight , and i wouldn t let her have my judy jetson thermos , so she threw it under the bus .
and then , oh , and then there was randy brown , who was like .
.
.
have you ever had a boyfriend who was like your best friend ?
well , but that s what he was for me .
and she you know , kind of stole him away , and then .
.
.
broke his heart .
.
.
and then he wouldn t even talk to me any more .
because he said he didn t want to be around .
.
.
anything that looked like either one of us .
oh .
.
.
oh , pheebs .
i mean , i know joey is not my boyfriend , or my thermos , or anything , but .

oh .
nope , that patch is no good .
come on , it s a hypnosis tape .
this woman at work used it for two weeks straight and she hasn t smoked since .
pffhah .
what s your problem ?
nothing , it s just that hypnosis is beyond crap .
ross , i watched you get hypnotised in atlantic city .
hey , that guy did not hypnotise me !
okay .
oh right ,  because you always pull your pants down at the count of three and play wipe out on your butt cheeks .
all right , y'know forget hypnosis .
the way to quit smoking is you have to dance naked in a field of heather , and then bath in the sweat of six healthy young men .
or what my father called thursday night .

to score the winning touchdown , by the way .

she d also like to thank my friends , chandler , monica , ross , phoebe , and rachel who s sittin  right there !

!
i should ve won one and i really want it and she didn t even care enough to come to the thing !
it could also be a grammy .
no !
joey !

no one saw me take it !
there was a whole table full of  them .
do you really want an award you didn t win ?
no !
i want an award i did win !

i can t believe someone would do that for a grade .

chandler is nowhere around so go ahead get it out of your system .
that guy s cute .
phoebe !
come on i m serious !
i just got to talk to him about all this .
no that is the last thing you want to do !
why ?
because you re marrying him !
you got to help me out here pheebs .
all right , i ve never been engaged and i ve never really been married , but i can only tell you what my mother told me .
whenever you have doubts or fears or anxieties about a relationship , do not communicate them to your husband .
so i m not supposed to share my doubts and fears with the guy i m going to spend the rest of my life with ?
that is correct !
yes , you re supposed to take all of that stuff and put it in a little box in your mind and then lock it up tight .
your mother told you this ?
yes !
the woman that got married a bunch of times and killed herself when you were 13 ?
oh my god !
you re right !
go !
go tell chandler !
hurry before it s too late !
wait no !
does this also mean putting out doesn t get you love ?

okay .
well , i think the centerpieces are too big you re wrong !
the centerpieces are fine !
do you ever get scared at all ?
kind of .
they re really big .
doesn t it ever just freak you out that that you re never going to be with anybody new again ?
what ?
just , i love you so much .
just it s just sometimes it bothers me that i m never going to have that feeling .
y know when you meet someone for the first time and it s new and exciting ?
y know that rush ?
no .
no , see when i first meet somebody it s uh it s mostly panic , anxiety , and a great deal of sweating .
okay , but all right you re a guy , does it not freak you that you re never going to sleep with anybody else ?
sleeping with somebody new , anxiety , panic , and i m afraid even more sweating .
even with me ?
i was dangerously dehydrated during the first six months of our relationship .
look , for me the rush is knowing that we are going to be together for the rest of our lives .

hey !
hi !
i brought you my old maternity clothes !
oh pheebs that s so sweet ooh , those are so cute !

he was in ross s class marching band kind of overweight ?
well , really overweight .
i mean i was his thin friend .
wow !
i don t remember him .
honey , are you sure you re not talking about your imaginary boyfriend .
no that was jarred !
wow !
i haven t thought about him in a long time    anyway , umm will s , will s here on business and he didn t have a place to go so i invited him here .
oh that s nice .
oh , and by the way , he s lost a bunch of weight .
i mean he looks goo ood !
okay , i mean really , really gorgeous !
i still love chandler .
i just want you to say it once in a while .
all right okay , just so you know , i m not going to make a turkey this year .
what ?
!
well phoebe doesn t eat turkey  phoebe !
turkey s are beautiful , intelligent animals !
no they re not !
they re ugly and stupid and delicious !
all right !
okay , it s just phoebe .
will s still on a diet , chandler doesn t eat thanksgiving food , and rachel s having her aversion to poultry .
she is ?
remember i had to leave the room the other day when you had that roast chicken ?
yeah .
but i thought that was because i put the whole thing on my hand and made it walk across the table .
anyway , it just doesn t seem worth it to make a whole turkey for just three people .
okay ?
it s a lot of work .
but you got to have turkey on thanksgiving !
i mean , thanksgiving with no turkey is like like fourth of july with no apple pie !
or friday with no two pizzas !
all right fine !
if it means that much to you !
but just there s going to be a ton left over .
no there won t !
i promise i will finish that turkey !
all right , you re telling me you can eat an entire turkey in just one sitting ?
that s right !
because i m a tribbiani !
and this is what we do !
i mean we may not be great thinkers or world leaders , we don t read a lot or run very fast , but damnit !
we can eat !
hey , isn t weird to think about how next year at this time they ll be a little baby at the table ?
rachel s !
but good to know where you re at !
hey !
hey !
happy thanksgiving !
you too !
anything i can do to help ?
actually there is .

i swear i didn t .
hey !
is that why you guys used to go up to your bedroom and lock the door ?
hmm , a little relieved , i got to say .
look rach i i m sorry , okay ?
i i was a stupid kid , okay ?
the only reason i joined   co founded .
co founded the club was because i was insanely in love with you .
obviously i didn t handle it very well .
but if you think about it the i hate rachel club was really the i love rachel club .
okay .
so what ?
you guys would just like get together and like just say mean things about me ?
no no !
no no .
no no .
what ?
!
what else did you do ?
what rumor ?
oh , come on will !
just take off your shirt and tell us !
ross !
it was no big deal .
we we said that the rumor was that umm you had both male and female reproductive parts .
what ?
!
oh my god !
you started that ?
!
what ?
!
you heard that ?
!
everyone at our school heard it !
everybody at my school heard it !
you were the hermaphrodite cheerleader from long island ?
!
oh no !
!
!
!
oh my god !
!
this is all making so much sense to me now !
this is why adam carter wouldn t go out with me !
this is why billy tratt would just stay in this region !
actually , billy tratt is gay now .
so so that one s not really our fault .
monica , how come you never told me this ?
!
i thought it might be true .
and i was afraid that you were going to cry and then show it to me .
joey stop staring !
there s nothing there !
it s not true !
i m afraid i m going to need proof .
oh !
you are my everest .
joey , you don t have to finish that .
oh yes i do .
otherwise what s next ?
today i m just a guy who can t finish a turkey , but tomorrow i m the guy who eats half a powerbar , wraps up the rest , and puts in the fridge ?
no !
no , i just i just i got to change my pants .
jeans have no give .
okay !
okay !
listen to what sean mcmahon wrote in my yearbook senior year , dear rach , you re such a good person .
not girl !
person !
rach , i think you re reading a little too much into it .
dear rach , you re a great person .
sorry about your tiney wienie .
look , what do you want me to do ?
do you want me to call everyone in the entire school and tell them it wasn t true ?
!
yes !
oh !
me too !
well look look i m not calling anybody !
okay ?
it was like a million years ago !
i don t care how long ago it was !
you told people that i was half and half !
y know what ?
i just want to point out i never did anything to hurt you in high school .
that s not totally true .
what ?
what ?
well you you did start that rumor about ross making out with mrs .
altman , our 50 year old librarian .
how did you know that ?
!
!
!
!
it s true ?
!
!
no .
yes it is !
i saw you guys going at it behind the card catalog !
i m sorry .
when you were in high school you made out with a 50 year old woman ?
hey !
she didn t look 50 !
did she look 16 ?
ohh , there s a picture of her in the yearbook actually .
oh !
wow !
she didn t photograph well !
well , she probably wasn t familiar with the process having spent most of her life sitting for oil paintings !
so how did this happen ?
did she , did she lure you to an early bird dinner ?
i was working late in the library one afternoon .
it was just the two of us .
she needed some help with her word jumble .
and one thing led to another .
if you must know , anita was very gentle and tender .
may she rest in peace  didn t she walk with a cane ?
only when it was damp !
!
i can t believe you you told people about this ?
!
everybody knew ?
!
y know what ?
i m back in the club !
i want to join !
wh phoebe !
!
i m sorry .
i m sorry .
i never got to be in a club .
i i didn t go to high school , but three of us would meet behind a dumpster to learn french .
bonjour .
all right , y know fine !
you guys have your stupid little club , but i would just like to say is what you did to me is way worse than what i did to you !
you gave me a tiney wienie !
all right , listen you re just being silly .
rachel , even with that rumor you were one of the most popular girls in school and everyone wanted to be like you .
one girl wanted to be like you so much she stuffed her pants with a tootsie roll !
wow  and ross , if it weren t for rachel s rumor i mean no one in high school would even know who you were .
she put you on the map !
as a romancer of the elderly .
hey !
mrs .
altman was the kind of woman you could tell she used to be pretty .
the eyes did still sparkle .
hey guys this stuff is just so way in the past .
you you ve been through so much since then .
and right now you ve got so much more important stuff going on in your life .
can t you just let this go ?
she s right .
yeah .
i mean we are having a baby together .
yeah .
nope .
okay .
it s exactly how i d imagined it would be .
all right where s that turkey !
joey !
those are my maternity pants !
not now !
these are my thanksgiving pants !
well that s it .
i m done .
whew !
there come the meat sweats .
well joey , we re all we re all very proud of you .

you can keep those pants by the way .
whoa hey wh wh what do you got there ?

no .
no .
no ?
no .
rosita does not move .
i m sorry , rosita ?
as in  as in rosita does not move .
joey , it s just a chair !
what s the big deal ?
the big deal is that it is the exact equal distance from the bathroom to the kitchen and it s at the perfect angle so you don t get any glare coming of off stevie .
stevie the tv ?
is there a problem ?
no !
oh what does he know !
come on rosita , us chichas got to stick together !
you bitch !
hey , y know what s weird ?
after you guys get married , when you introduce me to people you re going to have to say , this is my brother in law ross .
not , my friend ross ,  brother in law ross .
that s weird isn t it ?
couldn t i just say , this is ross ?
sure , do whatever you want .
hey ross !
so , i was checking out the uh , real estate section  yeah ?
look at this .
oh , it looks like mom and dad s house .
oh , it even has a tree with a broken limb out front and the uh , the window in the attic is oh my god !
!
what ?
what happened to the window in the attic ?
!
i can t believe mom and dad are selling the house !
i can t believe they they didn t even tell us !
i can t believe i still don t know what happened to the window in the attic !
uh , hello dad !

yes we re surprised !

i mean y know , she did always put your comfort first .
that s true .
okay ?

yeah , i   i don t want stevie to see her like this .
i can t believe we have to say goodbye to the house we grew up in .
man , some some stranger s going to be living in my room .
well , after 15 years of mom and dad keeping it as a shrine to you , it s time the velvet ropes came down .
they kept your room for a while .
oh please !
dad turned my room into a gym 20 minutes after i moved out !
i got to say , a tanning bed and a stack of victoria s secret catalogues , not a gym !
come on , you know they love you .
as much as they love you ?
i was their first born !
they thought she was barren !
it s not my fault .
hey .
hey .
hey !
ugh , i hate this year !

well okay , it s already february and i ve only given two massages and they were both the worst tippers in the world !
that was me and ross .
oh that s right !
hey , y know if you want to pick up some extra cash ?
some friends of mine made good money doing telemarketing .
oh that s a great idea .
you re really good on the phone .

she s heeled !
that s weird .
no it s not weird , it s a miracle !
it s not a miracle joey !
i m sure there s some explanation .
oh there is !
if you want something enough and your heart is pure , wondrous things can happen !
joey , i really don t   can you tell me how this happened ?

maybe somebody came in here and fixed it !
or something !
someone like an angel ?
that s right joey , the chair angel came in and heeled your chair .
get your non believer ass outta my chair !
dad that won t matter to her .
look , all my stuff is safe and dry and all her is is , is growing new stuff !

all right so earl , let s just forget about the people at the office , okay ?
there there s got to be someone else in your life worth sticking around for !
what about what about your family , your friends , or maybe your girlfriend ?

i can t believe i even fit into this shirt !
oh , this is yours .
oh , i don t know how that got in there .
this isn t mine .
hey , this isn t , this isn t my stuff !
ugh , ross !
these are your boxes !
where are my boxes ?
umm , your boxes are umm  what ?
dad ?
just mine ?
so why why wasn t ross s stuff ruined ?
and if you say the words medical marvel i m going to easy bake your head !
so wait , ross s stuff is fine , but i have no memories because you wanted to keep the bottom two inches of your car away from water !
!
!
i can t believe this !
hey chandler !
hey !
how would you like to sit in a chair that fully reclines , has a rolling massage , and speakers in the head rest ?
yeah , i d love to but i ve tried that so many times they won t even let me in the store anymore .
well what if i told you , you can do it in my apartment ?
are you telling me that you bought the chair that is making all other lounge systems obsolete ?
the chair that sit magazine called the chair of the year ?
i just purchased the la z boy e cliner 3000 .
that s awesome !
that s great !
what made you do it ?
!
well , it s a long story , but umm i broke joey s chair  whoa whoa whoa !
you broke joey s chair ?
yeah .
i thought i broke joey s chair !
that s why i replaced it with mine !
ohhhhh .
that s how it got fixed !
well , what did you think , that that elves came in and fixed it ?
noo !
angels .
i m gettin  my chair back !
what ?
wh hey !
well , it looks like it wasn t heeled after all !
yeah !
so , i guess this chair is mine now !
joey you broke my chair !
!
your chair ?
!
yeah , he thought he broke your chair so he switched the chairs !
so , there was no miracle ?
!
no joe , no miracle .
oh no this is devastating !
my faith is shaken .
i m so glad i have the new chair to get my through this difficult time in my life .
uh huh !
nice try , but you don t get that chair anymore !
all right ?
that is my chair now !
you can sit on my lap !
no i take that back !
i think i should get the chair !
how do you figure ?
because you  broke a chair and you  broke a chair !
the only one around here that hasn t broke a chair , is me !
no no no !
this chair s not going anywhere .
well , where s the logic in that ?
!
the logic is , that there are two of us and we are both strong enough to break a chair in half !
so joey breaks my chair and i get nothing !
that s right !
what are you guys ?
like a gang or something ?
!
yeah !
we are !
we re the cobras !
excuse me !
can you tell me where i can find earl ?
he s the supply manager around here .

no !
think about it okay ?
this isn t even my regular job !
okay ?
and my first day on the job , you re my first call !
and and somebody else might ve hung up on you , but i wouldn t do that because i know about this stuff .
my mom killed herself .
yes .
i m not going to give you tips !
look don t you see that this this this all came together so that i could stop you from doing this .
no , it s fate !
oh .

why would he turn off the tv ?
all right , y know what , come on , do we really have to watch this while we eat ?

you re going to call out her name and say , i love you !
and she s going to say , i love you , too !
and you guys are going to have the most amazing kiss , everyone at the gate will applaud .
i am a good kisser .
then you two can , can sneak into the cockpit , and things will start to heat up , and then a stewardess comes in   i ve been watching too much porn .
is that the heartbeat ?
oh my god !

why don t take care of this one , and should i get pregnant again , i ll hold onto your card , okay ?

it is not over !
you re over !
what ?

no , no , that that , that s all right .
umm , i m just glad you called .
does that mean the same thing in england as it does in america ?
she doesn t know which one of us she wants , me or this colin guy .
this isn t how it s supposed to go , there can t be another guy .
well  of course there s another guy !
!
this is even more perfect !
now you have to prove your love !
i m not proving anything .
okay , i m done listening to you .
if i hadn t let you talk me into going to the airport in the first place , i never would ve put my fist through the wall !
you put your fist through the wall ?
no , i missed and hit the door .
but , it opened really hard !
you have to go to london !
what ?
yeah , you have to go fight for her !
oh yeah , sure , that makes sense .
yeah .
because you already told her you love her and she didn t say it back , then she called you and told you that there s another guy , so yeah , go to london that ll scare her !
when rachel was with paulo , what did you do ?
i made fun of his accent .
you sat back and let him have her , you didn t fight at all .
am i right ?
do you want the same thing to happen with emily ?
no .
all right then , go fight for her !
go to london !
i mean , that could be you and emily !
that , but but nicer .
just , go to london !
really ?
come on !
surprise her !
show up at her doorstep !
don t let her go without a fight !
all right .
all right , i m going to do it !
all right .
i m going to , i m going to go to london and i m going to fight for her .
okay , good luck !
ross !
ross !
if you re going to the airport , could you pick me up another one of those toblerone bars ?
hey !
ooh ooh !
i did it !
i did it !
i figured out a way to make money !
i m going to open up my own massage place and frank s going to help me !
and !
we can work it around his schedule so he doesn t have to quit school !
that s sounds great , but how are you going to afford it ?
well , we were walking down the street and we saw that van that you guys used for catering and we realised  i m telling it !
i m telling it !
okay .
okay .
you know how people need transportation , but they also need massages to help them relax so i just figured we could combine the two , okay , i give the massages and frank drives !
i can fix up the van , bolt the table in the back , and you know what i ve got ?
a place where no one will ever get out alive ?
no !
think about it , it s a taxi that people take when they need to relax , it s   relaxi taxi !
the name was my favourite part !
well , well i can up with it !
you did not !
!
!
!
oh !
no !
you came up with relaxi cab !
that s not good .
well , i  hello .
hey .
oh my god !
ross , are you in england ?
was emily surprised ?
no , because she hasn t come home yet .
and she hasn t been home all night !
she s obviously staying with that other guy , and i m the stupid moron who spent the whole night outside her apartment !
all right .
when is , when is the next flight out ?
about four hours .
okay , just stay there a couple more hours and if she doesn t show up by then , then just come on home .
hey , tell him about relaxi taxi , and and ask him if he thinks that s better than relaxi cab .
okay , it s not relaxi cab .
it s relaxicab , like taxicab .
oh , that is better .
are we in london ?
what are you doing here ?
you can t be here !

i know , yeah .
i feel like we are all growing up .
person named wiener , god that kills me .
look at you all grown up .
actually , you know what ?
i am .
that whole thing with rachel made me realize that maybe I am ready for a more serious relationship .
you know ?
like I would like to meet a nice mature commitment minded lady .
and looks are not as important as .
nah , she is got to be hot .
you know , i might know somebody .
hey , how about you set me up with someone , and we double date !

no .
i can not be away from you for that long .

yeah , you are my husband .
I am not going to live in a different state than you for 208 days out of the year .

dr .
wiener .
rach , you can not call people at three in the morning .

yes , of course there is !
okay ?
I am not insane !
well , what was it ?
hiccups .
rach , i told you , you can not call him every time any little thing comes up .
yeah well , not anymore i can not .
he fired us !
what are we going to do ?
we have to find a pediatrician .
wait wait , monica said that when you guys were growing up , you really liked your doctor .
what was his name ?
dr .
gettleman ?
yeah i know , i do not think that is a good idea .
in fact , i think he is dead .
argh !
why does everything happen to me ?
!
rach , i promise first thing tomorrow we will find another doctor , but i got to get up early and I am not feeling all that well .
what ?
what , do you mean you are not feeling well ?
what do you have ?
is it rubella ?
because do not go near emma , she has not had that shot .
you know ?
come to think of it , it does feel rubella like !
wiener , wiener  wiener , wiener !
!
!
rachel !
!
!
great !
now he is going to know it was me !
hey !
hey !
so how is this for our big double date tonight ?
oh my god !
ooh , great !
just the reaction i was hoping for .
yeah , so you found someone for me .
you did not forget ?
of course not !
and you are going to love mary ellen .
she is really smart and cute and funny , and i can not tell you how i know this , but she ' not opposed to threesomes .
so tell me some about my guy .
no .
come on , give me something .
what is his name ?
mike .
mike ?
okay !
what is his last name ?
damnit !
is there no mystery left in romance anymore !
?
all right , we will se you and mike at the restaurant in a couple hours .
why did i have to say mike ?
i do not know a mike !
why could not i have said .
.
.
there is no guy in there !
it is impossible to find a good doctor .
i mean , how do you know the good ones from the ones who are going to push their penis against your knee ?
excuse me ?
i know what she is talking about .
we have got to find a new pediatrician .
ross was getting sick last night , and i think emma may have caught it .
why do not you go see dr .
gettleman ?
ross said he died .
he did not die .
i saw his daughter last week .
said he was fine .
her on the other hand , botched botox .
oh , great !
well , then I am going to take emma to see him .
i wonder why ross said that he died .
oh , maybe he was getting him confused with his childhood therapist .
he saw a therapist ?
yeah , he used to have this recurring nightmare , just really freaked him out .
why ?
what was it ?
that i was going to eat him .
mike !
!
!
okay !
everything is going to be fine .
just follow my lead , okay ?
all you have to do is pretend to be mike .
atta boy !
okay , look .
.
.
joey , this is mary ellen jenkins .
so , mike , how do you and joey know each other anyway ?
from school .
wow , you guys go way back then .
so what are you up to these days ?
mike , 'attorney at law ' !
what ?
that is the kind of thing you usually run by me .
wow , that is great !
i liked that better than the law thing , so .
.
.
which is why i waited until now to introduce you to mike .
no , no , that is not what i meant .
let us get you a cocktail .
hey !
hey !
what are you doing ?
looking for restaurant jobs for you in tulsa .
that is so sweet .
find anything ?
slim pickings .
nothing , huh ?
no , 'slim pickings ' , it is a barbecue restaurant .
they are looking for a cook .
actually 'cook ' may be a bit of a stretch .
they are looking for someone to shovel mesquite .
'slim pickings ' .
that is so cheesy .
'so cheesy ' also has an opening .
honey , that is okay .
i actually know this woman , nancy , who is a restaurant biz head hunter .
maybe she will know of something .
can i just say how much i appreciate you coming with me .
when we get to tulsa I am taking you for a great dinner at 'slim pickings ' .
'so cheesy ' ?
'whole hog ' ?
it is going to be tough to keep kosher in tulsa .
hi , nancy .
hi , it is monica geller .
I am good .
listen , I am looking for a job in tulsa .
well yeah , my husband has been relocated .
because i love him !
no , i do not want a job in new york .
javo  is looking ?
oh my god !
he asked for me personally ?
oh my god !
oh , wow , this is really flattering , but I am moving to tulsa .
yeah , so if you would tell javo  'I will take it ! '
hi , my name is rachel green , i have an appointment for emma .
thanks doctor .
you even have to ask ?
!
he is alive !
you know , it is so surprising that you and joey have known each other for so long and I have never heard about you .
yeah , that is because we had a bit of a falling out .
mike hit my mom with a car .
that is okay mike , i have forgiven you .
and now we are friends again everything's great !
please , we are trying to have a conversation .
what ?
!
what ?
!
do you not know each other ?
of course we do !
mike is playing a game that we used to play in high school .
yeah , where we pretend we do not know each other .
we played all kinds of games .
hey , remember the one where i punch you in the face for not being cool ?
!
mike , let me ask you something .
how many sisters does joey have ?
what are you doing ?
i said seven !
argh !
!
!
joey , why did you set me up with a stranger ?
because i forgot about our date , I am so sorry .
you are unbelievable !
i spent so much time finding the perfect girl for you , you know .
mary ellen is really smart and cute and loose .
who are you kidding ?
you just find some guy off the street for me ?
oh god !
this is humiliating !
look phoebe I am so sorry !
hey , look , if you do not like this guy i can find you a better one .
mike !
!
mike !
!
I am out of here   you are leaving too ?
good night !
honey , we are leaving tomorrow you have still got a lot of packing to do .
you are right .
maybe i should not go .
what ?
so nancy told me about this job at this great restaurant , javo  .
it is just a little outside of tulsa .
how far outside ?
manhattan .
and you are thinking of taking it ?
so before you said being me with me was more important than any job , but i guess now it is old job ,  me ,  new job .
I am going to miss this hand !
okay i know it is a lot to ask , but oh my god chandler , this is a once in a lifetime opportunity .
what happened to 'you can not live without me four days a week ' ?
well , if you really think about it , i mean four days is not that long .
i mean , i see you monday before you go to work , and i see you thursday when you get back , and i always work late on tuesdays , so really if you think about it , it is really just one day .
and well , if we can not make it one day , we have got real problems my friend .
i think you should take the job .
really ?
yeah .
i know it must be important to you when you start chattering like a monkey .
that is the nicest anyone has ever said to me !
hey !
how was the pediatrician ?
oh , i really liked him .
yeah , it was really , really , really good .
you promised you would not say anything .
i know .
ross still sees his pediatrician !
!
!
i do not care !
are you serious ?
you still see dr .
gettleman ?
he is a brilliant diagnostician !
diagnostician or boo boo fixer ?
ross , seriously !
you have got to go to an appropriate doctor .
why ?
why ?
i know it is a little weird , but hey , he is a great doctor , okay ?
he knows my medical history , and every time i go in there , he makes a big deal .
'ah look , it is my favorite patient ! '
does he say that before he sticks his thermometer in your touchy ?
hey , i seem to remember someone bringing his security blanket to college !
that was not a security blanket !
that was a wall hanging !
it did not spend much time on the wall !
!
!
sure .
why did you go along with that ?
that is true .
well , is anything you told me about yourself true ?
prove it .
that would not stand in the way of a true pianist .
you are really good !
i play a little guitar myself .
uhuh .
well , like acoustic folksy stuff .
you know ?
but right now I am working on a couple 'iron maiden ' covers .
it is okay .
go ahead , ask me out .
oh , you just caught me off guard !
yeah , that would be nice .
look at this .
my two best friends !
excuse me , i do not mean to be a jerk , but the baby with the rash came in after me .
with the circus ?
he is behind the elephant .
yeah , that is how i know .
I am ross by the way .
i am a single parent .
well , let us say , i do not know , you met someone in the pediatrician's office .
hmm , yeah .
come on ross jr .
it is time to go in .
hey , i helped you find waldo !
oh good , you have not left yet .
where have you been ?
i got held up at dr .
gettleman's office .

would you go out with me ?
ennnh .
ooh , are we allowed to lie in the vows ?
!
well maybe you don t talk about your feelings back then .
maybe you just say something about y know all the things that he s taught you .

now everybody knows the basic erogenous zones .
you got one , two three , four  , five , six , and seven !
there are seven ?
!
that s one ?
it s kind of an important one !
oh , y know y know what , i was looking at it upside down .

!
yes , but you cannot tell anyone !
no one knows !
how ?
!
when ?
!
it happened in london .

the reason we did not tell anyone was because we did not want to make a big deal out of it .
but it is a big deal !
!
i have to tell someone !
no no no no no !
you can not !
please ?
please ?
!
we just do not want to deal with telling everyone , okay ?

yes , but y'know what ?
it does not matter who knows what .
now , enough of us know that we can just tell them that we know !
then all the lying and the secrets would finally be over !
or , we could not tell them we know and have a little fun of our own all right honey , we would better go if we want to catch that movie .
bye !
bye chandler !
i miss you already .
okay , did you see that ?

chip !
hi , it s rachel .
rachel green .

oh , that s right !
he called to ask out monica !
that that s got to be embarrassing !
.
dumb , drunken , bitch !
!
!
thank you , thanks .
hey , here s a question ; where did you guys get the finest oak east of the mississippi ?
uh huh , first you tell us where you got the prettiest lace in all the land .
i m reading your ad .
looks good , uh ?
yeah .
stunning entertainment center .
fine ,  fine italian craftsmanship .
oh my god , you guys are selling the entertainment center ?
why ?
i love that thing .
you want it ?
ahh , gepeto , $5,000 dollars ?
are you insane ?
hey , the ad alone cost 300 bucks !
all right look , i m changing it to 50 bucks , or your best offer .
what kind of profit is that ?
!
and you call yourself an accountant .
nooo .
oh .
what do you do ?
i can t believe you don t know what i do for a living !
yeah , i actually don t know .
.
.
good , so do i something to do with numbers ?
oh my god !
no !
shoo !
kitty !
no !
no no no !
shoo !
come on , you !
come on .
crazy .
oh my god .
what ?
nothing .
nothing .
what ?
what s wrong ?
i just , i just have this really strong feeling that this cat is my mother .
you mean the mom you met in montauk .
she was a cat ?
!
no , no no , she was a human lady .
this is the spirit of my mom lily , the one who killed herself .
are you sure she s in the cat , or have you been taking your grandma s glycoma medicine again ?
no dr .
skeptismo !
i m sure .
first of all , okay , there s the feeling .
okay , and for another , how about the fact that she went into my guitar case which is lined with orange felt .
my mother s favourite fish is orange roughy .
.
.
cats .
.
like .
.
fish !
hi , mommy .
oh , i haven t seen this smile in 17 years !
dude , phoebe s mom has got a huge peni .
.
.
let it go !
!
hey !
umm , when were you going to tell me that you re going out with chip matthews ?
now ?
is it okay if i go out with chip matthews ?
nooo !
it s not okay !
i can t believe you would want to after what he did to me !
what , that little thing at the prom ?
monica !
i couldn t find him for two hours !
he was having sex with amy welch !
come on , that was back in high school !
how could that still bother you ?
i mean why , of all people would you want to go out with chip ?
!
look , you and i went to different high schools .
.
.
okay , that doesn t help me , because we went to the same high school .
you went to one where you were popular , and you got to ride off chip s motorcycle , and wear his letterman jacket .
i went to one where i wore a band uniform they had to have specially made .
they had to have that specially made ?
!
it was a project for one of the home ec classes .
oh my god , they told us that was for the mascot !
back then , i thought that i would never , ever get the chance to go out with a chip matthews , and now he s he s called me up and asked me out .
and the fat girl inside of me really wants to go .
i i owe her this .
i never let her eat .
oh , you go out with him .
oh , really ?
!
yeah .
just , if it s possible , could you leave him somewhere and go have sex with another guy ?
i ll try .
so you guys having any luck getting rid of the entertainment center ?
well , there were a couple of calls last night , but ah , i don t think any of them are going to work out .
yes , joey has a very careful screening process .
apparently , not everyone is qualified to own wood and nails .
stop it !
stop it !
she keeps squirming , trying to get away !
just like when she was alive .
so pheebs , how long is your mom going to be with us ?
well , i m not sure .
i mean , i guess until she y'know , gets used to the fact that there s y'know , a new mom .
y'know , i think she s worried that y'know , she s going to , she s going to be replaced .
well , that s not going to happen is it ?
noo .
okay , i have to return a call in the other room .
why can t you use the phone in here ?
well , i m returning a call from a certain mom at the b e a c h .
i just spelled the wrong word .
so , guys , am i crazy , or does phoebe s mom remind anyone of a cat ?
ross , don t start .
come on , you you can t tell me you actually believe that that there s a woman inside that cat !
i believe it .
no you don t .
yes , i do .
no you do y'know what , you re not going to suck me into this .
oh sure i am , because you always have to be right .
i do not always have to be okay , okay .
jurassic park could happen .
pretty nice ?
you ll have to pardon my roommate , he wanted to marry this .
y'know , i , i really don t think we need a canoe .
all right , just , just take the entertainment center , and then when you get home , throw the canoe away !
good for you !
!
you guys , you re never going to believe what i just found tacked up on a telephone pole !
look kind of familiar ?
apparently phoebe s mother also goes by the name julio .
you guys , there s a little girl in soho looking for this cat .
i mean , you know what that means ?
!
yeah eah !
200 dollar reward , split five ways !
!
do we have to tell her ?
yes , we have to tell her !
oh , but it s made her so happy .
little girl misses her cat .
crazy lady thinks her mother is in a cat .
okay , y'know what , i have to go have dinner with my son , can i trust that when you see phoebe , you will tell her .
thank you .
i hate when ross is right !
he is right , isn t he ?
y'know what , i think this might be one of the times he s wrong .
oh no , he s right .
hi .
hi !
uh , pheebs , about your mom .
.
.
yeah ?
how s that going ?
so great .
oh , we took a nap today and my mom fell asleep on my tummy and purred .

ross , a sports car ?

she doesn t want her parents to know she s drunk .

here s what we ll do , i ll get twice as drunk as monica and then no one s will even notice her .
what s what s going on ?
phil s really pissed !
monica s wasted .
maybe that will liven up this party .
okay , will you just go help her change please !
okay , but taking care of a drunk , naked woman seems like a job for joey .
yep .
ahh !

always stick to the list .
no !
no no , i love it .
thank you .
okay , open ours next .
open ours next !

now that you re a couple , we don t get two presents from you guys ?
for my last birthday you gave me a hug !
okay , read the card !
read the card !
okay .
happy birthday grandma !
it s better to be over the hill  then buried under it .
all our love monica and chandler .
that s funny , yeah !
no no no no !
that was the joke !
no , i know !
i get it !
it s funny !
no , because you re not a grandmother !
no i know , because to be a grandmother you have to be married and have children and i don t have any of those things .
that s why it s so funny .
all you had to do was buy the card !
hey !
look who s back !
it s the birthday girl !
how s the birthday girl feeling ?
well , i feel fine , but i think you re bumming out the rest of the kids .
what ?
okay !
y know what ?
i realized it was stupid to get upset about not having a husband and kids .
all i really needed was a plan .
see i want to have three kids  oh let me guess , and you want to have them all at the same time and you want to have them for your brother .
as i was saying  i should probably have the first of the three kids by the time i m 35 which gives me five years .
i love this plan !
i want to marry this plan !
if you could do that , i d marry the hippity hop .
so , if i want to have my kid when i m 35 , i don t have to get pregnant until i m 34 .
which gives prada four years to start making maternity clothes !
oh wait , but i do want to be married for a year before i get pregnant  really !
that long ?
!
look all you want , it s happening !
no , so i don t have to get married until i m 33 !
that s three years , that s three whole years oh , wait a minute though .
i ll need a year and a half to plan the wedding , and i d like to know the guy for a year , year and a half before we get engaged  which means i need to meet the guy by the time i m thirty .
which is fine !
because you just turned twenty eight !
no !
ross , no !
it is not fine !
eh eh according to my plan i should already be with the guy i want to marry !
will you quit hoggin  it !
i m telling you it s like watching bambi learn how to walk .
you re drunk !
mom and dad are going to be maaaaadd !
maybe i m a little drunk .
oh that s great !
right there !
can we get some of that over here please ?
there we go .
hey !
are those crab cakes ?
did i not tell ya to come straight to me when more crab cakes were ready ?
how are you feeling ?
you are so handsome !
i want to make love to you right here , right now !
i really wish that you wouldn t .
now all you have to do is just get through a little bit more , okay ?
then we can put you in bed , okay ?
just smile and don t talk to anyone .
speech !
speech !
let s hear from the birthday girl !
huh ?
pheebs !
!
don t you see ?

uh , good news everyone , we finally found a nanny .
this is molly  .
molly , chandler , joey .
ooh , somebody is getting a little fussy .
you damn right i am , I have been waiting for a cookie for 7 minutes .
ok , you know what , I am just going to take her outside .
ok , thank you .
yeah , you too .
oh , wow , molly is just great !
yeah .
yes , bravo on the hot nanny .
what ?
you really think she is hot ?
are you kidding ?
if i was not married she would be rejecting me right now .
and joey ?
how do you think she is doing ?
am i the only one who does not think that she is hot ?
ross ?
eh , i mean , i mena she is not unattractive but hot ?
i  .
.
.
.
thank you !
now that rachel's gone ?
so hot i cried myself to sleep last night .
hey mike , what is the capital of peru ?
no .
it starts with a v  and ends with an x  .
helpfully with a to  in the middle .
what ?
oh , whew , no , that is bob .
well not so much a pet as , you know , an occasional visitor who i put food out for , you know .
kind of like santa .
except santa does not poop on the plate of cookies .
what are those ?
ok , fine , if it means that much to you I will get rid of bob .
so weird , you think he is so gross and you are willing to eat his crackers .
hello .
gavin , i just wanted to say thank you again for watching emma yesterday during the presentation .
i really owe you an appology .
well , when we first met , you know , i thought you were pompous and arrogant and obnoxious  .
.
.
no , i just mean that , you know , first impressions do not mean anything .
and i i think you are a really good guy and I am sorry that i misjudged you .
hello .
but you know what , hey , new day , new leaf , i am just really really happy  .
.
.
I am sorry , obviously heather's ass has something more important to say so I will just wait 'till it is finished .
i was giving you an appology and you were totally checking her out !
oh wow , you are really , you are really a creep .
oh yeah , I am jealous .
oh gavin , please , please look at my ass  .
stop looking at my ass !
i mean , i just think you are totally inappropriate , ok ?
this is a work environment , she is your subordinate .
that is totally different for two reasons .
one    i did not know that you knew that .
and two , i was not some creep staring at his ass , we had a deap meaningful relationship .
it was  .
.
.
oh my god .
he did not have a last name .
it was just tag  .
you know , like cher , or , you know , moses .
oh , you know what    my first impression of you was absolutely right .
you are arrogant , you are pompous  .
.
.
morgan !
morgan !
tag's last name was morgan !
huh !
yeah well what are you , his boyfriend ?
man , i wish i had a nanny like you .
sure .
would you stop staring at her ?
i was not staring .
i was leering .
what is the big deal with her ?
maybe she is attractive in an obvious kind of way .
yeah , obvious beauty's the worst .
you know , when it is right there in your face .
me , i like to have to work to find someone attractive .
makes me feel like i earned it .
looks like joey is doing allright with her .
yeah .
hey , that was nice of you guys to back off and let joey get the girl for once .
ok , I will be home right after work .
ok , by emma wemma demma , i love you    wovyou dovyou  .
.
.
they have elected me to talk to you about the baby talk    it is not so good .
hey , listen , joey , about molly , i really prefer if you did not go after her .
why not ?
because it took us months to find a good nanny and i would not want anything to , you know , drive her away .
so , what , you think I am just going to sleep with her and never call her again and things are going to get uncomfortable ?
yeah , sounds about right .
come on , there are plenty of other women out thereok ?
just    just forget about her , ok ?
just , she is off limits .
oh , man , why did have to go and say that for ?
now that you told me i can not have it makes me want her even more !
what are you , a child ?
yes !
joey , come on now , for me !
please , just just try to focus your sexual energy on someone else .
fine .
take me home !
hey mikey what are you doing ?
to kill bob ?
?
no , mike , i do not want to kill him !
i thought we were just going to capture him and , and you know , set him free in the country side where he can maybe meet a friendly possom and a wisecracking owl .
I will find bob , I will get him .
bob ?
bob !
robert !
oh wait , i think i hear him .
oh    oh my god !
bob had babies !
bob's a mom !
i do not know , i kind of like bob for a girl .
oh my god , we killed bob !
suzie ?
whazzup ?
?
seriously dude , 3 years ago .
listen , can you do me a favor ?
I am going to be out today .
can you just keep an eye on joey , make sure nothing happens between him and molly ?
you do not trust him ?
wh    no .
some woman who sounded a lot like joey called earlier and asked for her daughter , the hot nanny  .
is this really your long term plan , for me to run interference ?
because i could get a job any day now .
you do appear right on the cusp of something .
come on man , I am sure he will lose interest in a week or two , but for now can you please just do this for me ?
allright , fine , but do not blame me if it does not work .
because you know as well as i do that once joey sets his mind on something , more often than not , he is going to have sex with it .
well we got to do something , ok ?
nannies like her do not grow on trees .
picturing that tree ?
i am , yes .
where you going , joe ?
for a walk .
oh .
you mind if i join you ?
actually , that will be long .
you know , i really need to organize my thoughts .
your thoughts ?
plural ?
allright , fine , i only have one thought !
it is about the hot nanny , i got to see her !
I am afraid i can not let you do that , joe .
now you are telling me i can not see her ?
?
you guys are killing me !
she is forbidden fruit !
it is like  .
.
.
like she is the princess and I am the stable boy  .
.
.
why are you doing this , huh ?
did ross tell you not to let me go over there ?
yes , as a matter of fact he did , so i can not let you go .
huh .
interesting .
now there are obstacles .
hot nanny and me against the world .
this is the kind of stuff great novels are made of .
great novels ?
fine  .
.
.
mediocre porn rachel green's office !
!
give me that phone !
hello , this is rachel green , how can i help you ?
uh huh  .
.
.
ok then  .
.
.
I will pass you back to your son  um , excuse me gavin , i have a question i need to ask you .
if you like looking at butts so much why do not you just go look at a mirror ?
oh , please , i do not care about you enough to bug me .
in fact , from now on , I am going take the high road .
and I am going be very very nice to you , you momma's boy  , starting right now .
hey rach !
hi !
ready for your birthday lunch ?
yeah i am , i am !
oh , but first of all , monica , i would like to introduce you to my very talented colleage and more importantly my wonderful friend gavin mitchelle .
pleased to meet you .
so you are coming to rachel's party tonight ?
oh no no no no no , gavin can not , he already has plans , most likely with his mother .
why did you invite him ?
?
i can not stand that guy !
you were just being so nice to him !
i was faking it !
can not you tell when I am being fake ?
hey , mr philips , nice suit !
right there !
that was so fake !
shh !
i still can not believe you invited gavin .
allright , he is the last person i want to see .
oh , you are welcome for the party .
I am glad you are having a good time .
god , i hope he does not show up .
of course he is not going to show up , the guy hates me .
does he ?
what ?
maybe he is bothering you so much because he likes you .
it is like in first grade when skippy langwild always pushed me on the playground because he secretly had a crush on me ?
oh , monica , you think skippy liked you ?
honey , all those buys had a bet to see if he can knock you over .
oh , ok , thank you .
do you see what all the guys see in her ?
would not kick her out of bed .
no more vodka for me !
hey rach , so can i sing happy birthday to you now ?
yeah , sure !
oh  .
.
.
happy birth  .
.
.
oh , see you later  hey rach , somebody got you shoes !
oh , give me !
be careful , be careful !
these are my rat babies !
ahhhh  , you brought rats to my birthday party ?
so this is what a stroke feels like .
i had to bring them !
we killed their mother , they are our responsibility now .
you know , they require constant care .
you should know that , rachel , you are a mother .
are you comparing my daughter to a rat ?
no !
seven rats !
i think we should take them home , we need feed them .
whhh wait , you are going to leave my party to take care of a box of rats ?
well I am sorry rachel , but I am not like you , ok ?
not everyone can afford help .
where the hell are joey and molly ?
i asked you to watch them .
I am sorry , i got a little occupied .
we have to stop them before something happens !
right behind you , big guy !
so you see , molly , what people do not understand is that acting is a discipline .
it takes a lot of hard work .
oh , i did not go to college .
molly  .
.
.
people do not study acting  .
.
.
molly , ah , do you mind giving us just a minute ?
thanx .
will the stable boy never get the princess ?
?
what do you think you are going to do , have sex with her right here on my couch ?
no  .
.
.
the leather sticks to my ass .
you know , this is not fair .
what makes you think that I am just going to sleep with her and then blow her off ?
huh ?
can not you guys open your minds to the possibility that i actally like her , and might want something real ?
look , the truth is , i have not felt this way about anyone since rachel , ok ?
i did not think i could ever love again .
ok  yeah , come on in .
molly ?
ok  .
.
.
well , uh , joey , i guess we have no problem .
it is like my favorite fairy tale come true !
the princess , the stable boy and the lesbian !
ok , ok , you start preparing the formula and i start changing the box and then we got to put them straight to bed .
well , you know what , they are our responsibility now .
mate ?
they are all brothers and sisters .
no .
wh    get off your sister !
oh my god , what are we going to do ?
we have 7 rats .
so what if each of them has 7 rats ?
and then each of those have 7 rats ?
that is like  .
.
.
that is math i can not even do !
what are we going to do ?
yeah , ok .
i guess you are right .
allright , so we should just give them away .
but to nice families , with children , and reduced fat wheat thins .
they are bob's favorites .
you must think I am crazy .
good .
it is just so hard , it is hard for me to  .
.
.
let them go .
i guess it just brings back memories , you know , from  .
.
.
when i gave birth to my brother's triplets and i had to give them up .
i have not told you about that yet , have i ?
hey !
hi .
thanks for the party , honey .
should i help you clean up ?
no way !
you had your party , now i have mine !
is everything alright ?
yeah , i just get a little bummed when my birthday's over .
well , at least you have one thing to be happy about .
that jerk gavin from your office did not show up  .
mmm hmm .
oh , we were not talking about you .
no , no way to recover .
no .
well , it was , and you would have seen it if you did not showed up at   .
.
.
9:30 ?
?
god !
oh , this party was lame  .
.
.
again , you are welcome .
oh , you bought me a present !
why ?
aww .
well , ok , well that is very nice .
and you wrote a card  .
from gavin   awww , awww , it is beautiful .
see , gavin , you are capable of being a nice guy .
why did you give me such a hard time ?
well monica seems to think it is because you have feelings for me .
you do ?
see ?
why , gavin , why ?
right when I am about to change my opinion of you , you go and you  .
.
.
and you do that  .
.
.
first i was afraid , i was petrified   hey  hi listen , i think I have left something here .
oh , well someone left this  .
this is yours ?
no , but i like it .
i think i left one of my rat babies .
oh , uh , well , i have not seem it but if i do I will let you know .
ohmygod !
rat baby !
rat baby !
rat baby !
ooh , maybe that is him!hi !
hey !
hey !
we are just here to say goodbye , we are off to ohio .
oh , right !
your adoption interview !
yep , we are going to meet the lady who could be carrying our baby .
i can not believe it .
when you guys come back , you are going to have a baby !
that is so weird !
and so incorrect !
she is only a couple of months pregnant .
she liked our application but who knows if she is going to like us .
come on , she is going to love you guys !
uhm , thank you , but we are really trying not to get our hopes up .
and a lot could still get in our way .
yeah .
i mean , this girl could decide against adoption or she could like another couple better .
.
what are you going to name the baby ?
i can develop a condition in which i talk and talk and no one hears a word .
but just think , ok ?
what if everything goes right ?
what if this woman does pick you guys ?
oh my god .
she is going to pick us !
so we are standing firm on the 'not getting our hopes up ' ?
you know , i know that things could still go wrong but if they do not ?
if this works out , we are going to have a baby chandler , a baby !
yes , but .
.
.
oh my god , it is going to work !
we are going to make it work !
I am going to be a mummy and  you are going to be a daddy !
all right , I will see you suckers .
I am going to get me .
.
.
a baby !
{she leaves ) oh , screw it , I am going to be a daddy !
!
hey , who is phoebe with ?
I am going to say someone I am going to have sex with .
hey !
hey !
so .
.
.
who is your friend ?
oh , that is sarah .
no , no .
do not you get any ideas , ok ?
no , I am not setting you up with any more of my friends !
ow , why , why , why ?
because you will date her once , sleep with her and then forget she exists !
oh , name one friend of yours that i did that with .
mandy .
mandy , uh ?
uh .
.
.
really hot blonde , big boobs ?
no .
i know why i do not remember her , huh ?
do you think I am someone else ?
ok , i may not have treated your friends well in the past , but i have grown up a lot , really .
honest , rach ?
well , believe it or not , it is true .
when joey and i were together , he was wonderful .
he was thoughtful and mature .
and for the one week that we went out , he did not sleep with anybody else !
growth !
fine , I will give you her number .
ok , thank you .
and i promise you i will not forget this one .
mandy .
sarah !
saraaah .
hey !
hi !
hey you guys , i need some fashion advice .
oh !
how does this look ?
well , it is a little low .
.
.
pick up a little .
.
.
a little bit more .
.
.
a little bit more .
.
.
there you go !
now throw it away !
c'mon !
this looks good !
ross , please , trust me .
i buy 30 fashion magazines a month .
now , i do not know who is running for president or who that .
.
.
nato guy is , but i do know that you have to get as far away as you can from that hat .
damnit !
i have this date tomorrow night and i have to look cool !
well , you know , if you want fashion help , rachel and i are going shopping tomorrow .
you are more than welcome to come with us , right ?
really ?
that would be great .
i mean , i have to do something , she kind of teased me about how i dress .
i can see why , nice shirt !
you are wearing the same shirt .
stupid gap on every corner !
ok , thank you .
uh , well this is it .
are you ok ?
yeah .
just weird , you know .
it is like : hi , I am chandler .
may i have the human growing inside you ?
uh , we are going to be great .
you are going to be great .
well .
.
.
obviously !
hi .
it is so , so nice to meet you .
thank you so much for agreeing to see us .
ok .
that is what our friends call us .
i do not know about that .
i do not think that is exactly .
.
.
let her finish , doctor .
hey !
hey .
oh , my friend sarah had a great time last night .
well .
.
.
yeah !
so you are going to call this one back ?
nope .
what are you talking about ?
sarah's great !
oh , really ?
you know what your great friend did ?
we are out to dinner , ok ?
we are getting along , having a really nice time .
i was thinking she was really cool .
and then , out of nowhere .
.
.
that s it ?
that s why you won t go out with her again ?
so , she took some fries , big deal !
hey , hey , look !
it s not about a few fries .
.
.
it s about what the fries represent .
what ?
all food !
i m sorry , i can t believe i set you up with such a monster !
hey , hey , hey , hey .
look .
i take a girl out , she can order whatever she wants !
the more , the better !
all right ?
just don t order a garden salad and then eat my food !
that s a good way to lose some fingers !
oh hi thank god you re here .
listen to this !
what ?
joey and my friend were out last night and having dinner and she reaches over and takes a few of his fries .
.
.
oh !
oh , no !
what ?
you know about the plate thing ?
oh , yeah .
joey doesn t share food .
i mean , just last week we were having breakfast and he had a couple of grapes on his plate and  .
.
.
you wouldn t let her have a grape ?
oh no !
not me !
emma !
joey doesn t share food !
well , i still think that it s a stupid reason not to call someone again .
you are calling her !
and if you need to , just get an extra plate of fries for the table !
i like that !
a sharing buffer !
yeah !
i ll order some extra fries !
maybe a plate of onion rings .
yeah .
and a shrimp cocktail .
and some buffalo wings .
maybe an individual pizza , uh ?
and some mozzarella sticks .
what were we talking about ?
this place is awesome !
you know , we should just go , i m not going to find anything here !
this stuff is ridiculous !
ah , this place is great !
wow !
rach , come on , i m not going to wear any of this !
nothing silver .
.
ok ?
nothing with hair !
and nothing with padlocks on it !
.
ross , look , i know that some of this stuff is out there , but i mean , come on , look at this , look at this sweater !
.
i mean , this is just beautiful !
wow , this is really soft  .
three hundred and fifty dollars ?
yeah , down from seven hundred , you are saving like two hundred bucks !
both logic and math are taking a serious hit today .
wow !
yeah !
actually this looks like pretty good !
yeah !
boys will be boys ?
what ?
they will be !
all right , that s it , i m getting out of here .
no , no , no , no !
ross , wait !
come on !
you know , there s other stuff .
here s a nice shirt , look at these nice pants .
.
.
uh , actually these might look pretty good on me .
yes , they will !
you know what you should do ?
just go take a walk , all right ?
i know your size and i m .
.
.
i m going to pick up some really good stuff for you .
really ?
yes !
and i know what looks sexy on guys .
please , just wear what i suggest , and she s going to go nuts for you .
so , you re saying , uh , if i wear these pants i might be getting into hers ?
why do men keep talking to me like this ?
so , the fact that i am a doctor , and my wife s a reverend , that s important to you ?
amen .
plus i thought the baby would be in good hands with a doctor !
uh , good hands .
healing hands .
it says  do it !
.
and behold she did adopt onto them a baby .
and it was good .
yeah , wow .
oh , you know , my flock is good , i mean , yeah , my flock pretty much takes care of themselves at this point .
good flock .
flock , flock , flock .
no ot for me it doesn t .
yeah , actually .
so , you read a file that you liked and you gave the agency the serial number and they contacted us ?
you should be .
you re really on top of stuff .
.
we don t ?
oh my god , this is great !
this is so great !
.
did you hear that ?
yeah , i did .
hey , thank you .
thank you so much .
.
you are so going to heaven !
we got some really great stuff !
yeah , yeah but i am not sure about some of the bra's i got .
oh !
really ?
do you want to try some of them on for me ?
oh !
okay .
wait , are we in joey's imagination ?
oh no !
i took one of ross ' bags by oh , well , ross probably has it , you can get it from him later .
so ?
what do you think ?
i think were not wearing the same shirt anymore !
!
yeah !
yeah !
rachel picked it out for me .
she told me to trust her and you know what ?
I am glad i did !
i turned quite a few heads on my way over here .
dude , i really do not think you should be wearing that .
oh , i see , somebody is afraid of a little competition with the ladies ?
looks like someone is the ladies !
!
you are just jealous because you could not pull this off .
yeah , now if you will excuse me  i have a date .
see ?
all eyes on me !
we are not signing those papers .
why not ?
it is wrong .
they made a mistake .
they think we are somebody else .
god works in mysterious ways .
you have got to stop !
but she liked us .
she likes doctor chandler and reverend monica .
well , if you think about it , i am kind of like a reverend .
i mean , as a chef , i serve god , by feeing the hungry and poor .
your veal chop is $34,95 !
c'mon chandler , i think we have been given an opportunity .
i mean , the mistake has already been made .
they are writing up the paper right now .
but we are not the one she chose !
how can you feel okay about this ?
because .
.
.
we may not be who she thinks we are but no one will ever love that baby more than us .
i know .
.
i mean , who knows how long it is going to take for someone else to give us a baby ?
what if , what if no one ever picks us ?
oh , honey .
.
please .
.
please , we are so close .
monica , i want a baby too , but this woman is giving away her child .
she deserves to know who it is going to .
okay , right .
so , we will tell the truth and who knows , maybe she will like us for us .
maybe she will .
uh !
why could not i have been a reverend ?
you are jewish .
technicality !
oh , that looks great !

hi !
oh hi !
ross geller .
and this is my friend phoebe .
mr .
president .
howard ?
oh that is nice .
oh .
uhh  no no , it is not that , it is just  i i just moved in .
yes , but I have lived here for 25 minutes .
no wait , look .
look !
I am sorry , it is just I have never even met howard .
i i mean i do not know howard .
yes but too me he is just , man .
ugh , can you believe that guy !
yeah .
i really like his glasses .
so then president steve told everyone that i was a cheapskate , and now the whole building hates me !
a little kid spit on my knee !
y'know what I am going to do ?
I am going to throw a party .
that is right .
for everyone in the building , and I am going to sit them down and explain to them , i am not a bad guy .
i am not a cheap guy !
I am just a guy who who stands up for what he believes in .
a man with principles .
sounds like a fun party .
hmm .
look , ross , if you want your neighbors to like you , why do not you just pay the hundred bucks ?
the party's going to cost you way more than that .
it does not matter !
it is my principles !
we are talking about my principles !
okay , i thought it was about your neighbors liking you .
oh , they will like me .
once they come to my awesome par tay !
okay , i got to run .
i got to go get some nametags .
and that crazy party animal will be your brother in law .
very , very funny , but do not say things like that in front of monica .
i do not want you putting any ideas in her head .
umm , chandler , you do realize that those ideas are probably already in monica's head .
wh wh why ?
!
well , because she loves you and because you love her .
yeah , so , what is that supposed to mean ?
!
hey , chandler , do not freak out !
I am telling you something you already know !
come on , she broke up with richard because he did not want to have babies .
and she is a woman , and she is almost 30 , and y'know it is monica .
i do not see it that way .
okay ?
because , i see two monicas , the one that was my friend , who lived across the hall , and wanted to have a lot of babies and then the new monica , who i just started to date .
now , who is to say what she wants ?
!
i m right .
I am right .
am i right ?
no , you are right , you are absolutely right .
i mean that makes , that makes everything different .
okay .
it is not different at all , is it ?
not unless different means the same .
y'know , breadstick fangs are always funny .
uhh , look katie , uh listen , we we need to talk .
okay ?
umm , look i like you .
i i really do , i like you a lot .
okay ?
but sometimes when you , when you playfully punch me like that it it feels like someone is hitting me with a very tiny but very real bat .
is not this great ?
hmm .
could not you just stay like this forever ?
chandler !
could not you just stay here forever ?
yeah , here , somewhere else , y'know where where ever .
are you okay ?
yeah , I am cool .
casual .
what what are you doing ?
I am just hanging out .
y'know , having fun .
y'know with the girl that I am seeing casually .
man , i knew it !
i knew you were going to do this !
!
what ?
!
get all freaked out because everybody was talking and just joking around about marriage and stuff .
well , you do want all that stuff , right ?
oh and you know what i want !
yes !
you want babies !
you have baby fever !
i do not have baby fever !
oh please , you are obsessed with babies and and marriage and everything that is related to babies and and marriage !
I have got an idea , why do not we turn down the heat on this pressure cooker ?
!
have you lost your mind ?
chandler , this is not about me !
this is about you and all your weird relationship commitment crap !
nah uh !
i know you !
okay ?
i know the thoughts that you have in the head   in your head !
you do not know everything .
did you know that I am going out with rachel tonight instead of you ?
hmm ?
and did you know that the only baby around here is you ?
!
and did you know that i can not even look at you right now ?
!
well , i did not know that .
it is going to be okay , right ?
i mean she is not going to leave me ?
this is , this is fixable .
by me ?
oh , no !
no no .
well , unless you make some kind of big gesture .
yeah , big !
uh oh , shht !
the misses .
gunther , can i get a coffee  to go ?
monica .
I am still not done not wanting to talk to you .
just tell me what i need to do to make things right .
what ?
!
well , that is what we do .
y'know , i i mess up and then you tell me how to fix it and then i do and then y'know you think I am all cute again .
really ?
I am really tired of being your relationship tutor .
you are going to have to figure this one for yourself .
all right ?
y'know what ?
if you are too afraid to be in a real relationship , then do not be in one .
phoebe !
oh , hi ross !
what are you doing ?
oh , i thought this was your party and it turns out it s a party for howard .
he is just the sweetest little man !
you chipped in ?
!
yeah , uh huh , a 100 dollars .
phoebe !
i can not believe you gave them money !
i thought you agreed it was totally unreasonable that they asked me for that money !
yeah , but they did not ask me !
y'know ?
this way I am just y'know , the exotic , generous stranger .
that is always fun to be .
yeah , but you are making me look bad !
no I am not .
no !
if anything I am making you look better !
they will see you talking to me and that is   I am a hit !
hey !
yeah , okay , my bad .
hey !
hi !
wow !
you look , you look big .
thanks !
I have been working out .
hey listen , is it obvious that I am wearing six sweaters ?
uhhh , yeah .
but it is not obvious why .
well look , i m breaking up with katie so i had to put on some extra padding .
y'know ?
i mean , if she hits me when she is happy , can you imagine how hard she is going to hit me when i tell her I am taking away the joey love ?
hey !
hiya !
hey !
hey , cute jacket !
oh !
ow !
whoa !
y'know what katie ?
i got to tell ya i i i i think you are the one who is too much .
ohh , and the nicest girlfriend !
ohh , you are so sweet !
huh .
uhh  .
nah .
phoebe ?
that is what I am saying .
phoebe ?
phoebe ?
ooh .
look , this is a disaster !
can not i please just go ?
no !
no !
I am talking you up to people .
just give it a little time , all right ?
relax , get something to eat !
okay ?
so uh , what did you tell them about me ?
oh , i was telling them about you and emily .
y'know , try to get some sympathy .
ohh .
but somehow you came off as the bad guy .
what ?
!
yeah , i think i told it wrong .
y'know , we should talk about that because i do not totally understand what happened there .
ohh , this cake is really good !
oh , okay , see ?
things are looking up already !
all right , everyone calm down !
everyone calm down !
i have something that i would like to say !
who here likes ross ?
of course you do not like him !
he he did not give you any money , he raised his own hand when i asked , who hear likes ross ,  and he is wearing two nametags !
i I will be honest with you guys , when i first met ross i did not like him at all !
but then once i got to know him i saw that he is really sweet and caring and very generous .
i mean , all I am saying is do not judge ross before you get to know him all right ?
i mean , i like all you guys now , but when i first meet you y'know kurt , i thought , y'know abrasive drunk , umm lola , mind numbingly stupid !
and okay , you guys   gold digger ,  cradle robbing perv !
so , i think you all know what i mean .
obviously i did not think they were going to start throwing things .
i just thought if i kept insulting everyone , you would jump in and defend everyone and then you could look like the hero .
oh wow , yeah !
see , i did not get that .
where is monica ?
!
where is she ?
i need to talk to her !
it is urgent !
is she here ?
I am monica .
i need to talk to you , it is urgent !
okay .
okay , I have been doing a lot of thinking about us , y'know a lot of uhh , us thinking .
and uh , well i guess there is only one one way to do this .
wait what wh wh what are you doing ?
!
monica  no no , do not do not do not do it !
will you marry me ?
oh no .
no .
no .
what a bad idea !
ohhhh , i cannot look at it !
chandler , why are you doing this ?
i do not know .
but i know I am not afraid to do this .
chandler .
I am doing this because I am sorry ?
do you umm , you really think the best reason to get married is because you are sorry ?
no , the best reason to get married is pregnancy .
sorry is pretty much fourth y'know , behind being ready and actually wanting to get married .
will you be my wife ?
chandler , umm , i want you to take just a minute and i want you to think about how ridiculous this sounds .
yeah , I am kind of wishing everyone was not here right now .
honey !
do you know that none of that stuff came from me ?
!
i mean i never said i wanted to have babies and get married right now !
yeah i know , but i was really confused and then i talked to these guys .
who ?
two divorces and joey ?
!
hey !
she is right y'know .
yeah , but still , cheap shot !
y'know what ?
y'know when i said that i want you to deal with this relationship stuff all on your own ?
well , you are not ready for that .
i did not think i was !
oh my god , what would have done if i said yes ?
well i would have been happy because i would have be able to spend the rest of my life with the woman that i love .
or , you would have seen a chandler shaped hole in that door .
hey ross , will you pass me that knife ?
no , i will not !
oh , it is okay .
you do not have to be so mean about it .
you are right , I am sorry .
will you marry me ?
aw , and i was going to ask you to marry me because i forgot to say hello to you last week .
oh no wait pheebs , i think for something like that you just ask them to move in with you .
but I am not sure , chandler ?
okay , how long is this going to go on .
well i think the length of teasing is directly related to how insane you were so , a long time .
this is fun .
hey rach , remember that whole we were on a break thing ?
well , I am sorry , will you marry me ?
that is not funny .
that is not funny at all !
hey !
hey !
wow !
you look nice .
what is the occasion ?
monica and i are celebrating our ten month anniversary , we have got reservations at ja george .
wow !
how did you get in there ?
made a few calls , pulled some strings , and they agreed to seat us at 11:30 if we both had the chicken and did not get desert .
hey caitlin !
somebody got a haircut .
yeah , if that was true , gym class would have been a lot more interesting .
oh , okay .
here you go .
oh , he is in the back .
the duck pissed him off , said that eggs came first .
okay , bye !
what the hell was that ?
!
what ?
the flirting !
are not you supposed to be going out with , i do not know hmm , let us say my sister ?
!
i was not flirting .
it was totally flirting .
somebody got a haircut   okay first of all , the impression , uncanny .
and second , that was not flirting , that was just casual conversation between two people .
that is all .
yeah , right .
you want to see flirting ?
I will show you flirting .
I am good .
i am so proud of joey , i can not believe he is going to be on law  & order !
i know .
but do not you think that it should be called order and law ?
no because first they arrest the guy and then they try him .
do not get me started on that .
i was not flirting .
and on your anniversary , for shame !
what is going on ?
chandler was hitting on the hot delivery girl !
i was not and oh god , shh !
well I am sorry but you were !
okay ?
and besides if anyone should be hitting on her it is the guy who is single , the guy that who who who can do something about it .
sounds like somebody wants to be mr .
pizza delivery girl .
well  is that what this is about ?
you like caitlin ?
ross !
we broke up two years ago ; you have been married since then .
i think it is okay that we see other people .

we do not need her measurements .
okay pepperoni , pepperoni , pepperoni , okay ross , i know she is pretty and you love her , but is she stupid ?
!
she forgot my vegetarian !
this is perfect !
she will have to come back here with your pizza , and when she does , I will turn on the charm of ross .
oh I am so glad you do not eat meat .
see ?
vegetarianism benefits everyone .
hey everybody , look who is here !
you remember my grandmother !
big night !
this is so cool !
so , joey on law  & order , you must be very proud !
chandler , she does not understand a word of english .
I am sorry , i thought you were joey's other grandmother .
I have done it again .
she is my biggest fan .
yeah , she is the only one in the family that is believed in me .
yeah , i uh weighted like 27 pounds when i was born so   hey !

okay , but there is a big difference .
you are a lot hotter than i am .
true story !
chandler , this actually bothers you ?
yes , it does bother me !
and i think it would bother a lot of people .
rachel , when you were going out with ross , did it bother you when he flirted with other women ?
uhh , no , no , it bothered me when he slept with other women .
and thank you , for that .
but y'know , i never really had anything to worry about .
ross was never very good at the flirting thing .
what ?
what what , what are talking about ?
it it worked with you .
oh !
y'know what ?
you are right !
we meet , you flirted and then bamn nine years later you had me !

not likely .
because you see that body bag right there  yeah .
I am in it .
this is terrible , what are you going to do ?
i do not know .
this little , old lady lives for my career .
when they dumped me off of days of our lives she almost died .
that is not good .
no , smile !

so uh monica , do you , do you like the law  & order ?
yeah , it is good .
see , I am finding out all this stuff about you today , like you like the law  & order and that you flirted with every guy in the tri state area !
chandler !
okay , let me get this straight , it is okay for you to flirt , but not for me .
oh , I am so glad we cleared that up .
look , I am sorry , some things are different for men and for women .
go on , teach me something about men and women .
okay , I have already taught you so much already , but whatever .
see when you flirt with a guy you think , I am just flirting , no big deal .
but the guy is thinking , finally !
somebody who wants to sleep with me !
no way !
it is true .
well that is pathetic !
again true .
and this goes for all guys ?
all guys that are awake .
then we go to sleep and then all the guys from the other end of the world wake up and behave the exact same way .
all right , it is another commercial ; i still have not told her !
joey !

barry and mindy are getting a divorce !
oh my god !
wow !
what is the matter with you ?
!
no !
barry and mindy .
oh sorry , i hear divorce i immediately go to ross .
who who s barry and mindy ?
barry was the guy that i was almost married and mindy was my best friend .
ohh oh , wasn t he cheating on you with her ?
yeah , but that just means that he was falling asleep on top of her instead of me .
why did they get divorced ?
well , apparently she caught him cheating on her with someone else .
isn t that sad ?
god , could you imagine if i actually married him ?
!
i mean how different would my life be ?
i know what you mean , i ve always wondered how different my life would be if if i d never gotten divorced .
which time ?
the first time !
no seriously , imagine if carol hadn t realized she was a lesbian .
i can t .
i keep seeing it the good way .
i d bet i d still be doing my kara tay .
towards the end of our marriage i was doing a lot of kara tay as a way of releasing the tension from y know , not doing anything else physical .
maybe the problem was you were pronouncing it kara tay .
and what if i was still fat ?
well , you wouldn t be dating me , that s for sure .
sure i would !
what , you guys really think that i m that shallow ?
no , i just think monica was that fat .
hey , imagine if i never got fired off days of our lives !
oh hey , there s carol again !
what if i had had the guts to quit my job ?
i d probably be writing for the new yorker , getting paid to be funny .
but my job s fun too !
i mean tomorrow , i i don t have to wear a tie .
what if i had taken that job at merrill lynch ?
what ?
!
merrill lynch ?
yeah , i had a massage client who worked there and and he said i had a knack for stocks .
well why didn t you take the job ?
because at that time you see , i thought everything that rhymed was true .
so i thought y know that if i d work with stocks , i d have to live in a box , and only eat lox , and have a pet fox .
hey , do you guys think that if all those things happened , we d still hang out ?
oh my god !
rachel green ?
rob tillman !
no no .
it s it s me , ross !
oh , i m sorry .
ross tillman .
no , no no , ross geller .

do we have to know about that ?
joey , what are you going to do when you have a baby ?
I am going to be in the waitin ' room , handing out cigars .
yes , joey's made arrangements to have his baby in a movie from the 50's .
god , i do not believe this .
she could be giving birth in the cab .
oh , ross , relax .
it is probably like two dollars for the first contraction , and then fifty cents for each additional contraction .
what , it is ok when chandler does it ?
you have to pick your moments .
did i miss it , did i miss it ?
she is not even here yet .
what is with the guitar ?

come on , come on .
damnit , damnit , damnit , damnit .
this is all your fault .
this is supposed to be , like , the greatest day of my life , y'know ?
my son is being born , and i should be in there , you know , instead of stuck in a closet with you .
no no no , believe me .
no one has been waiting for this as much as i have , ok ?
and you know what the funny thing is ?
when this day is over , you get to go home with the baby , ok ?
where does that leave me ?
every day is lesbian lover day .
this is so great .
you want to explain that ?
i mean , well , because when i was growing up , you know my dad left , and my mother died , and my stepfather went to jail , so i barely had enough pieces of parents to make one whole one .
and here is this little baby who has like three whole parents who care about it so much that they are fighting over who gets to love it the most .
and it is not even born yet .
it is just , it is just the luckiest baby in the whole world .
I am sorry , you were fighting .
I am sure they will be here soon .
yeah , honey , they would not miss this .
relax .
you are only at nine centimeters .
and the baby's at zero station .
you are really frightening me .
somebody want to help me , tryin ' to rip out my heart .
uh , that is great .
anybody seen a nipple ?
ok , got the vent open .

it s yelling bleeding dilating .
oh , the dilating  is this the video of the baby being born ?
sweetie , this is phoebe s .
why were you even watching it ?
i thought maybe you got me porn for valentine s day .
chandler , if you thought i was going to get you porn for valentine s day   you were right !
apparently , it s about a young girl who moves to the big city , you know , in search of stardom , but ends up having sex with a lot of guys !
yeah , it got four starts !
oh , wait a minute .
those aren t stars .
anyway , you want to take a look ?
well , i m not really in a sexy mood right now .
honey , what s going on ?
well , remember the first time we saw jaws ?
mm hmm .
how long it took to go back in the water ?
chandler , we can t let this tape wreck valentine s day !
you don t know .
you didn t see it .
child birth , it s a natural thing !
it s beautiful .
oh , beautiful ?
really ?
beautiful ?
you think this is beautiful ?
oh !
oh , my god !
no wonder my mother hates me !
see , honey , there s  don t touch me !
hey !
so , how was atlantic city ?
yeah ?
wha  ?
oh , come on .
you didn t have to saltwater taffy ?
!
thanks !
this is interesting .
you know , most people think this is made with sea water , but it s actually made with , uh , salted fresh water .
that s not interesting .
i do too !
i missed you !
oh , it was good !
it was good .
actually , the baby started kicking !
yeah !
i know !
it was .
oh  the only sad thing is i wasn t around when it happened for the first time .
yeah , i m missing out on all this other stuff , too .
so , joey suggested rachel move in with me .
what ?
huh uh huh .
just a second !
how could you not tell mona that rachel is living with you ?
i don t know , she seemed to think it was such a crazy idea !
um , plus , she , uh , she got me taffy !
taffy , really ?
i ve never had any .
ever ?
!
well , i think my mother was too busy planning her suicide to provide saltwater treats .
thank you !
so what , you re just never going to tell her ?
oh , no , no , no , i will !
i just want to butter her up , first !
you know , i m going to take her to an amazing valentine s dinner .
do all this romantic stuff , and then , just when she thinks i m the best boyfriend in the world , then i m going to tell her that my pregnant ex girlfriend is living with me .
if i haven t said it before : she s a lucky , lucky lady !
so , where are you going to what the mother of crap is up with this stuff ?
oh , god .
is it gum , is it food ?
what s the deal ?
oh , it s nice !
may i try a pink one ?
so , between her and me being friends , and her history with ross , it just isn t going to happen .
it would be like you falling in love with a cat .
hey !
hey .
hey , buddy .
how s my favorite dog , huh ?
how s my favorite dog ?
you re subdued .
did you give him a beer ?
no .
will you excuse us , we need to talk for a moment .
yeah , sure .
go ahead .
oh , me , right !
he s miserable !
what happened to him ?
nothing .
we just talked about stuff .
what stuff ?
rachel stuff .
oh joey , you bummed him out !
this was the happiest dog in the world , and he spends half a day with you , and look at him !
he s breathing !
okay , i m going to take him back to wendy s .
no , no , no , no !
he s fine !
look , look , look !
here s your ball !
get your ball !
get your ball !
get your ball !
my god , what have i done to you , huh ?
i broke the dog !
pheebs , i broke the dog !
well , i m , uh , going to pick up mona .
what have you got going tonight ?
oh , i ve got big valentine s plans !
i ve got my chinese food on the way , and the rest of your saltwater taffy !
y know , it s interesting !
most people think that s made with seawater , when in fact  ross , we actually watched the documentary together .
ooh !
my chinese food !
let me get my cash !
mona ?
what are hi !
what are you doing here ?
i m , um , supposed to pick you up !
ayyyayyyy !
oh , hey , mona !
i have no idea !
i ll be watching tv if anybody needs me .
uh lately , she just likes hanging out here .
i think she s lonely .
i know .
no , no .
she s way to emotional .
and by emotional i mean crazy .
i m not here !
that s just my chinese food !
mm hmm .
she s she s emotional , but , but ballsy .
you know what i m going to do ?
i m going to get in my sweats , and eat this in bed !
and you thought she was going to be in our way !
so , why don t you , uh , open the champagne , and i ll be right back .
i ve got a surprise for you .
please start drinking !
i m just going to grab the phone .
oh , i m sorry !
do you need the phone ?
but , but , mona , i live here .
happy valentine s day !
or something to remember me by .
how long has it been this time ?
90 seconds .
that s better .
90 seconds is a long time not to think about it except all i did was think about it .
you know , it haunts me ?
up  til now , the worst thing i ever saw , was my father doing tequila shots off the naked houseboy .
after this , i would gladly make that my screensaver !
okay , well , we have to get past this !
why don t we get rid of the tape and pretend it never existed ?
i can do that .
okay .
okay .
now all we ve got to do is get rid of this chair .
oh , thank god !
oh , i know !
come in !
hi !
i m so sorry to barge in on your valentine s , but i had to get away from all the yelling .
mona is dumping ross .
oh , my god .
poor ross .
oh , great .
we have to watch him do yoga in his underwear , but for this he closes the drapes !
rach , you know that birthing tape you wanted to see ?
it s here .
oh , and we should warn you , before you watch it : don t watch it .
why ?
you saw it ?
is it scary ?
well , let s just say it s ironic how footage of someone being born can make you want to kill yourself .
well , now , wait .
now i m all freaked out .
come on , you guys will watch it with me .
no , but i will leave a sweater that smells like me right next to you !
c mon , seriously , you guys , you re not going to make me watch this alone !
she s right of course not .
honey , get the tape .
this reminds me of a very specific part of the tape .
okay , here we go .
okay .
ooh , my !
woah !
why is that baby torturing that woman ?
!
why have i seen this thing three times ?
!
it s still beautiful .
uh !
it s horrible !
i know !
i know , i m so sorry for you !
oh , my god !
wait , you guys , look !
what ?
did her ass explode ?
!
no , the baby s out !
look , look !
oh , look at those little fingers and toes !
and look how happy the mom is now !
oh rach !
oh , screw you guys , you don t have to do it !
hey , hey , man !
hey , what s up ?
uh mona just dumped me .
oh , man , i m sorry .
why ?
well , with everything that s been going on lately , i haven t exactly been the perfect boyfriend .
you know , i , uh , i didn t tell her i got rachel pregnant .
i gave her a key to my apartment , and then had the locks changed !
and then i lied to her about rachel moving in with me .
in a way , i actually judge her for not breaking up with me sooner , you know ?
still , that really sucks , man .
especially on valentine s day .
yeah .
wait a minute .
what are you doing here ?
joey tribbiani without a date on valentine s day ?
what s going on , huh ?
girl trouble ?
sort of .

hey hey , hey !
i don t know why i did that !

chandler , wh why don t we sit down ?
yeah , i ll sit down .
it s good to see you yes .
what were you thinking ?
!
i didn t know it was an auction !

i figured , take a guess , help a charity , free boat !
why would a charity give away a free boat ?
!
i don t know !
charity ?
ugh !
well , just buy the damn boat !
phoebe , don t you think you ve had enough to drink ?
i m just helping the kids !
how is you drinking helping the kids ?
because the more i drink , the less there is for the kids to drink .
oh hi !
just out of curiosity , how how much is that boat worth ?
hey , i was pretty close .
uhh , so bad news .
umm , i can t buy the boat , i don t have any money .
joey !
joey , good one !
so uh listen , i think i m going to take off now .
hey !
you can t leave joey !
you agreed to buy that boat , all right ?
!
that is a contract !
and plus if you leave , my boss is going to kill me !
well , what am i going to do rach ?
!
i don t have that kind of money !
i know .
okay .
okay .
okay .
all right .
all right , this is what we re going to do , we are going to go to the next highest bidder , and we are just going to let them buy it , and then you re just going to pay the difference .
okay .
okay .
look , i don t know why the kids need a youth center anyway !
y know ?
they should just watch tv after school like i did and i turned out fine !
not great .
and so , we re hiding in the bathroom .
so i hide in the shower and the next thing you know they re going at it right on the bathroom floor .
i got a good one , i got a good one !
i once walked in on both my parents making love to the same guy .
ohh .
what ?
!
oh my god , you guys !
!
before you say anything , have we got a story for you !
guess who we bumped into at dinner !
who ?
richard !
what ?
a ohh !
ohh .
oh that s right that s right .
that s richard s favorite place too .
oh you knew that .
good !
i thought you were going out with elizabeth .
yeah , i was but uh , she was a little busy with a water balloon fight .
oh ross , sometimes grown ups have commitments they just can t get out of !
y know , maybe she is too young for me .
y know , when i was over there and she was running around with her friends , i felt like i was a baby sitter .
i finally started to see what you guys were talking about .
i don t know what to do .
why don t you just weigh out the good stuff about the relationship against the bad stuff .
i mean that s what i did when i first  weighing stuff .
okay umm , bad stuff .
well , i m i m 12 years older than she is .
if the school finds out you re fired .
hmm .
she s leaving for three months .
for camp !
okay , good stuff .
umm , well she s she s sweet and pretty and  look ross , the only question you need to ask is , do you see a future ?
i mean like do you see yourself marrying her ?
oh my god !
you did it already !
you married her , didn t you ?
!
no !
no !
i didn t do that .
it s just  okay , honestly no .
i don t , i don t see a big future with her .
okay well i think that s your answer .
i ve got to talk to her .
ugh , i hate this part .
hey , you have to forget about elizabeth .
i mean if you re not careful you may not get married at all this year !
rach !
rachel !
okay , the next highest bidder is at table one .
oh great !
oh and uh the guy who got the paris trip is at table four .
oh , okay .
why do you care about the guy who won the paris trip ?
it s a trip for two !

!
i i ll make payments , whatever it takes , i want the mr .
bowmont !
!
oh my god , you re back !
ohh , let me see it !
let me see your hand !
why do you want to see my hand ?
i want to see what s in your hand .
i want to see the trash .
yeah .
eww !
oh , it s all dirty .
you should throw this out .
okay .
what did you guys just do ?
!
what happened ?
richard was there so i couldn t do it !
what ?
!
noooo   i m going to do it tomorrow y know , and and surprise her , but now you ve ruined it !
we didn t ruin it !
who walks into a room and asks to see a person s hands ?
!
well , a palm reader , a manicurist , a hand doctor  glove salesman !
good one !
yeah .
this is terrible .
what am i going to do ?
look , she only suspects something okay ?
she doesn t know for sure , so just throw her off the track .
that s right , i can throw her off .
i can make her think marriage is the last thing on my mind .
yeah !
yeah !
convince her that that you re scared of commitment !
convince her that you re a little coward !
i can do that , i ve had 30 years of practice .
hey , being you is finally going to pay off !
i had to go all the way to the basement because some idiot keeps stuffing the trash chute with pizza boxes !
that guy s still doing that ?
!
hey !
oh my god you re here , let me see your hand !
!
no , you re too late !
!
!
she already took out the trash !
!
!
wow !
i have never had such a healthy break up !
she was such a grown up about it !
she didn t seem too immature for me !
did i just make a huge mistake ?
elizabeth , thank god !
i was just thinking about  what ?
!
okay , break up s still on !
okay , okay , here she comes !
how do i look ?
do i look like a guy who doesn t want to get married ?
yeah !
and also , a little like a french guy .
i never noticed that before .
hi guys !
hey !
hey !
what are you up too ?
oh , just hanging out , talkin  about uh , websites .
yeah , we saw this really interesting website about marriage and how totally unnecessary it is and how its just a way for the government to keep tabs on you .
yeah , big brother .
well that s a little crazy .
although i am y know glad to hear that you re branching out on what you look at on the internet .
yeah , well  y know , it just got me thinking though , why would anybody ever want to get married huh ?
why ?
!
to celebrate your relationship !
to solidify your commitment !
to declare your love for one another to the world !
eh  okay well that s good to know .
the mr .
bowmont s here !
!
!
sure , i love this part !
richard !
ohh  oh , that s okay i hate when people come back to complement the chef .
like i have nothing better to do !
so what s up ?
oh , good to see you too .
did you come down here to tell me that ?
what uh what did you what ?
!
y know you re really not supposed to be back here !
oh god   why don t they put chairs back here ?
!
what the  yes you re too late !
where was all this three years ago ?
!
what were you doing in africa ?
ohhh !
what are you doing to me ?
!
oh look , i i  i m sorry but umm , this this this this is not going to happen .
well he is !
yeah , i mean marriage is all he talks about !
my goodness , in fact , i m the one that s making him wait !
yeah !
why ?
because of the government .
isn t it incredible ?
!
monica and chandler , gettin  married .
i know , they re going to be so happy together .
ohh  i mean two best friends falling in love , how often does that happen ?
not that often !
no !
i m so happy for them !
me too !
so happy for them !
i m so happy and not at all jealous .
oh no !
no god , definitely not jealous !
i mean i m probably 98 % happy , maybe 2 % jealous .
and i mean what s 2 % ?
that s nothing .
totally .
i m like 90/10 .
yeah me too .
hey uh , have you guys scene chandler ?
wh no , but y know who did stop in here looking for ya , tennille .
so that marriage stuff that you were saying yesterday , you don t really believe that do you ?
sure i do .
in fact , i think the whole concept of marriage is unnatural .
i mean look at pigs .
let s take a second here and look at pigs .
okay pigs don t mate for life .
i mean a pig can have like a hundred sexual partners in a lifetime , and that s just an ordinary pig not even a pig that s good at sports !
yeah , but that s pigs not people !
if marriage worked , i d be all for it .
but do you know what the divorce rate in this country is ?
97 % .
wait a minute .
are you honestly telling me that that you may never want to get married ?
well , never say never but y know probably uh yeah , never .
oh my god !
then then then what are we even doing ?
!
what is this ?
!
whoa !
whoa !
whoa !
what is all this pressure ?
!
is this some new kind of strategy ?
why don t you put down your copy of  the rules  huh mantrap ?
!
y know what ?
!
i got to go !
ugh !
it s okay , i got a plan .
we re going to find love !
definitely !
yeah , i m pretty confident about that .
that s what makes it so easy for me to be 80 % happy for monica and chandler !
it would be nice to have a little guarantee though .
what do you mean ?
well y know , some people make deals with a friend , like if neither of them are married by the time they re 40 , they marry each other .
you mean a backup ?
exactly !
yeah , yeah i got that .
you do ?
hm mmm .
who ?
joey .
joey ?
!
yeah !
are you serious ?
!
yeah , i locked him years ago !
wh  so  if neither of you are married by the time you re 40 , you re going to marry joey .
yep , we shook on it .
yeah but believe me that is not how he wanted to seal the deal .
oh , seriously ?
ohh , yeah .
i think his exact words were   charming .
well hey , it s just a backup .
yeah .
hey monica !
have you seen rachel ?
or a mirror ?
this is for my boat , pretty cool huh ?
yeah , it s great .
whoa whoa , what s the matter ?
!
talk to the captain !
i m just having one of those days where you realize you re in a dead end relationship !
chandler giving you a hard time huh ?
it s not like i want to get married tomorrow !
it s just that i i d like to believe that i m in a relationship that s actually going somewhere , that i m not just wasting my time !
well , you know chandler .
no i don t know chandler !
not anymore !
it s like it s like something s changed .
maybe you changed ?
i didn t change !
maybe that s the problem .
what ?
!
chandler is a complex fellow , one who is unlikely to take a wife .
is that some kind of boat talk ?
i don t know !
i haven t totally decided how to talk on my boat yet .
what does he think ?
does he think i m just going to wait around for nothing ?
monica face it , chandler is against marriage .
and and always will be !
well there s some people who do want to marry me .
there are ?
yeah !
richard !
r r richard said he wants to marry you ?
!
and and chandler s tellin  ya how much he hates marriage ?
!
that s right .
chandler loves marriage !
!
you just told me that he hates marriage !
that that he s a a complex fellow who s unlikely to take a wife !
that that he s against marriage and always will be !
you got that from what i said ?
!
what happened you guys ?
rach !
hey you !
hey , come on in .
oh thank you .
hey y know , i m so sorry to hear about you and elizabeth .
oh , thanks .
yeah , i really thought we d be able to make it work , but uh , i guess it just wasn t meant to be .
yeah , love .
it s a tricky business isn t it ?
i guess so .
so what do you say we make a pact ?
if you and i are both single by the time we re 40 , we get married .
i mean , we know each other , we like each other , and we ve we ve already slept together so y know there ll be no surprises there !
you know what i mean ?
no like , what s that ?
!
right .
ohh !
you you want me to be your backup .
exactly .
ohh , yeah i already have one .
what ?
who ?
phoebe .
phoebe ?
!
wait a but but she just , she said that joey was her backup .
ohh , i don t think so .
ross !
i just had a conversation with her , and she said that she and joey made a deal !
that s impossible !
i mean we have had a deal for years !
we we we shook on it , although believe me she wanted to do a lot more than that .
where the hell have you been ?
!
i was making a coconut phone with the professor .
richard told monica he wants to marry her !
what ?
!
yeah !
yeah , i ve been trying to find ya to tell to stop messing with her and maybe i would have if these  damn boat shoes wouldn t keep flying off !
my oh my god !
i know !
they suck !
!
he s not supposed to ask my girlfriend to marry him !
i m supposed to do that !
i know !
well what  y know what i m going to do ?
i m going to go over there ; i m going to kick his ass !
will you help me ?
!
look , chandler i don t think us getting our asses kicked is a solution .
okay ?
just go and find monica !
you re right .
yeah !
okay .
i m going to get the ring !
i m going to get the ring !
i m going to go find her and  i m just going to propose !
okay .
okay great .
dude dude dude !
what ?
!
let me know about that coconut phone , it might great for the boat .
hi .
i don t know why i m here .
i don t know .
chandler is such an idiot !
yeah , i ll have a scotch   still smoking cigars ?
no that s , that s okay .
uh yeah , i i actually i thought about you a couple months ago .
yeah but it was because i i had an eye exam and i don t like my new eye doctor .
edward nevski ?
no .
but getting over was the hardest thing that i ve ever had to do .
and i never let myself think about you .
phoebe !
you picked joey and ross ?
!
you can not have two backups !
of course i can !
it s just good sense to backup your backup !
look , i ve already lost chandler !
what ?
!
hey !
hey !
phoebe !
we re both  your backup ?
!
phoebe , how could you do this to me ?
!
i don t look i don t know what you re complaining about now ?
you were both aware of the situation !
no we weren t !
i was not !
okay , this kind of back talk is not going to fly when we re married !
phoebe you can t have both of them !
you have to pick one !
pick me !
!
no !
pick me !
i don t want to end up an old maid !
all right well let s see , ross is a good father , but joey has a boat this is hard !

all right here , this is what we re going to do !
i m going to write joey on one napkin  and i m going to right ross on the other napkin  and we are going to pick one !

my girlfriend is out there thinking things over !
you made my girlfriend think !
!
and what does she have to think about ?
i love her !

this was just a plan , y know ?
a way to throw her off course so that when i offered her all these things , she d be surprised !
it was working until you showed up , you big tree !
i mean , this isn t fair .
you had your chance with her !
you had your chance and you blew it !
and this is my chance and i am not going to blow it because we are meant for each other !

well , there you go .
oh , hey .

well , I am crazy about her now .
i think this could be the real thing .
capital 'are ' !
capital 't ' !
do not worry , those are the right letters .
look , what do you want me to say ?
i want you to say that you like her !
i can not .
it is like this chemical thing , you know .
every time she starts laughing , i just want to  pull my arm off just so that i can have something to throw at her .
thanks for trying .
oh , and by the way there is no count rushmore !
yeah , then then who is the guy that painted the faces on the mountain ?
how could you have told her ?
ross , i did not think it would that big of a deal .
oh , she did not think it would be that big of deal .
okay , who are you talking to when you do that ?
look , that was supposed to be like a private , personal thing between us .
okay , ross , phoebe is my girlfriend , okay , we tell each other everything .
you know , i mean , come on , guys do the same thing , i mean , what about all that locker room stuff .
that is different , okay .
that is like , uh 'who dated a stripper ? '
or 'who did it on the back of the staton island ferry ? '
.
were both of those joey ?
yeah .
look , you do not , you do not talk about like , you know , your girlfriend and the intimate stuff you , you do with her .
not even with your best friend .
noo !
that is so sad .
your missing out on so much , ross .
i mean , the bonding and the sharing , you know .
and and knowing that someone else is going through the same thing you are .
hmph .
so what you , you tell each other everything ?
pretty much .
did you talk about the night of five times ?
do you tell people about the night of five times ?
uh , honey , yeah that was with carol .
i know , but it is still worth mentioning , i think .
relax every muscle in your body .
listen to the plinky plunky music .
okay , now close you eyes , and think of a happy place .
okay , tell me your happy place .
richard's living room , drinking wine .
all right .
no , no , no , not a richard thing , just put down the glass .
and get out !
I am sorry , but that is my happy place .
well , okay , fine , use my happy place .
okay , I am just going to , i have to ask that you do not move anything .
all right , I will try not to .
okay , all right , so , your in a meadow , millions of stars in the sky .
.
.
.
do you think breaking up with him was a huge mistake ?
all right , there are no questions in the happy place .
okay , just , the warm breeze , and the moonlight flowing through the trees .
.
.
.
I will bet he is totally over me , I will bet he is fine .
all right , betting and wagering of any kind , are , I am sure , not permitted in the happy place .
okay .
just just , you know , the the lovely waterfalls , and the , the trickling fountains .
and the the calming sounds of the babbling brook .
.
.
.
okay , this is not working .
I am still awake and now i have to pee .
i , ah , i never said hate , i was very careful about that .
and you got a 'hate ' from that ?
!
your taking a big leap there .
.
.
but what does that going to do .
.
.
okay .
I am in .
does it have to be a whole day ?
yeah , i know , i sleep in the next room .
so , i went down to the post office , and it turns out it was those videos that i ordered for richard about the civil war .
he loved the civil war .
monica , do you want us to take you home ?
uh , huh .
or maybe to a galaxy far , far away .
women tell each other everything .
did you know that ?
umm , yeah .
no chandler , everything !
like stuff you like , stuff she likes , technique , stamina , girth .
.
.
.
girth ?
why , why , why , wh why , why , why , why would they do this ?
rachel says sharing's great and supposedly , you know , we outta be doing it .
do you want to ?
we are not going to talk about girth are we ?
nooo !
yeah , okay .
yeah ?
yeah !
all right !
you go first .
okay , okay , I will go first .
okay .
so , uh , the other night rachel and i are in bed talking about fantasies , and i happened to describe a particular star wars thing .
.
.
.
princess leia in the gold bikini .
yes !
i know !
yes !
wow , well , that that was easy .
okay , you you go .
okay .
okay .
okay , you know , you know when your in bed , with a woman .
hmph .
and , ah , you know , your fooling around with her .
and you get all these like , mental images in your brain , you know , like elle macpherson , or that girl at the xerox place .
.
.
.
with the belly button ring ?
oh , muhawa !
i know , and then all of the sudden your mom pops into your head .
and your like 'mom , get outta here ! '
you know , but of course , like , after that you can not possibly think of anything else , and you can not , you know , stop what your doing .
so it is kind of like , you are , you know .
you know .
.
.
.
you do not know !
your mom , your telling me , your telling me , about your mom , what is the matter with you ?
you said .
.
.
i said 'share ' not 'scare ' .
go sit over there !
.
hey !
what are you guys doing together ?
really .
yeah , yeah .
we went to a mets game , we got chinese food , and you know , i love this woman .
you have got competition buddy .
you still can not stand her can you ?
I am sorry man , i tired , i really did .
well , you know , i appreciate you giving it a shot .
but , hey , look , you know the good thing is , is that we spent the whole day together and i survived , and what is even more amazing , so did she .
it was bat day at shea stadium .
well , i guess that is something .
no man , that is huge !
now , i know i can stand to be around her , which means i get to hang out with you , which is kind of the whole point , anyway .
okay .
oh , hey , chandler , we , ah , we stopped by the coffee shop and ran into ross .
oh god !
hey , if it makes you feel any better , i do it too .
really ?
oh yeah , i always picture your mom when I am having sex .
hi , dad , what are you doing here ?
i do not , i just , i just like the smell of them .
so , uh , what are you really doing here dad ?
what makes you think that i might not be okay ?
oh .
I am fine , just a little tired , I am okay .
how is richard doing ?
no , i really , really do .
really !
you are not just saying that are you ?
was he crying ?
well , do you think he was waiting 'til after you left , so he could cry ?
i think so .
okay , here we go .
I am jabba's prisoner , and you have a really weird look on your face .
what ?
honey , what is it ?
did i get it wrong ?
did i get the hair wrong ?
what ?
did you just picture it differently ?
what ?
what ?
no , no it is , um , it is not you , um , it is um , it is  i hate chandler , the bastard ruined my life .
I am fine , thanks .
yeah , see , i can not pull of baby doll can i ?
no .
i think we learned that from the sugarlips incident .
I am going to get some tea .
okay .
hiya doin ' pumpkin ?
nope .
so it looks like it is going really well for you two , huh ?
oh my god !
i think that is so great !

i swear , i promise .
i promise .
oh my god , I am so excited !
{and i just can not hide it !
I am about to lose control and i think i like it !
sorry , just could not resist it . }
all right , listen let me tell you , do not get her flowers .
okay ?
because y'know , she cries when they die , and there is the whole funeral  okay .
bye !
so , what movie should we see ?
gary's going to ask you to move in with him !
!
what ?
!
really ?
!
he just told me at the counter .
he made me promise not to tell , but i could not hold it in any longer !
i can not believe this !
right , because it is fast .
because , it is so fast .
it is fast !
relax !
it is phoebe !
not you !
oh !
good for you pheebs , way to go !
no , but it is fast .
is not it ?
ohhhh !
no , i like him a lot but i do not think I am ready for this !
so , what are you going to do ?
i do not know .
I will just handle it I will ask you to talk to him !
me ?
!
why me ?
because you are so afraid of commitment !
you talk to him , make him scared like you !
make him a man !
I will try , but I am not sure what good it would do , y'know ?
because I am a lot less afraid of commitment than i used to be .
that is so sweet !
still terrified , I will take care of it .
no problem .
hey ross , is uh , is staten island really an island ?
uh huh , that is why they call it staten island .
ohhh .
i thought it was like long island .
also an island .
hey , what time is it ?
2:17 .
wow !
you realize that we have been throwing this ball , without dropping it , for like an hour ?
are you serious ?
!
yeah .
i realized it about a half hour ago but i did not want to say anything because i did not want to jinx it .
wow !
we are pretty good at this !
hey !
we totally forgot about lunch !
oh , i i , i think that is the first time i ever missed a meal !
yeah , my pants are a little loose !
hey , you guys  hey !
is monica here ?
all right listen umm , i just bought something I am not sure she is going to like it , and it is going to seem a little crazy , but this is something that i wanted since i was a little girl .
you bought shawn cassidy !
noo !
i wish !
okay , you ready ?
okay !
check it out !
what what is it ?
!
what the hell is that ?
!
!
it is a , it is a cat !
that , is not a cat !
{i have to agree with joey on this one . }
yes it is !
why is it inside out ?
!
excuse me !
but this is a purebred , show quality sphinx cat !
how much did you pay for that ?
well , it was a little extravagant , but i a pretty good deal .
yeah ?
how much ?
a thousand bucks .
on a cat ?
?
!
!
!
!
it is not a cat !
all right listen ball boys !
my grandmother had one of these when i was a little girl and it was the sweetest thing !
i mean it was so cute , it would sit in my lap and purr all day long , and i would drag a shoestring on the ground and he would chase it !
free cats do that too , y'know .
{which reminds me , if i might get a little political here , support your local animal shelter .
pet shops are not the place to buy dogs and cats from , you get a much better deal from the shelter , plus they probably will not die on you in a week and a half .
if you want a leash , go to the pet shop .
if you want the dog for that leash , go to the shelter and save it is life .
now back to regularly scheduled programming . }
it is not a cat !
ugh !
look you guys , I am really excited about this !
okay ?
i do not care what you think !
I am going to go set up a little litter box for mrs .
whiskerson .
well , what am i going to call her ?
fluffy ?
!
hey , you want to get something to eat or uh , do you want to see how long we can throw this ball back and forth ?
huh ?
uhh , the ball thing .
yeah ?
hey ross , would not it be great if we could go two straight hours without dropping it ?
!
uhh , yeah it would !
let us do it !
okay !
uh oh .
what ?
i have to pee .
and rachel's in the bathroom !
man , i did not think we were going to make it !
i know !
do not switch hands , okay ?
hey ladies !
what are you in here for ?
gary , I am here to report a crime .
it is a crime that you and i do not spend more time together .
well , i heard that you thinking about asking phoebe to move in with you and i thought maybe , we should have a talk .
man to uh , me .
uh , are you crazy ?
are you insane ?
if you live with phoebe , you two are going to be y'know , live living together !
you mean scared .
scared ?
happy ?
i am trying to open your eyes , my man !
do not you see , if you lived with phoebe she is always going to be there .
you are going to get home , she is there .
you go to bed , she is there .
you wake up and oh yes , she is there !
were you are parents happy , or something ?
wow , y'know when you say it , it does not sound so scary .
yeah , i think i do !
y'know what ?
you move in with her !
you move in with her right now !
maybe i should in with monica !
yeah , you are right about that .
now when they found the remains of the mesozoic mastodon they discovered what appeared to be the remains of a paleozoic amphibian in its jaws !
how did it get there ?
!
maybe this should be more of a quiet game .
hey guys !
hi !
joey , i left my watch on the counter last night .
it was right here , where is it ?
i do not know .
all right , come on , I am I am late for work !

!
monica , whatever you do , do not drop that ball !
yeah , we have not dropped it in   2 hours , 27 minutes .

!
oh yeah , i got a cat .
i do not want a cat !
oh , do not worry , it is not a cat .
yeah .
you guys this cat is nothing like my grandmother's cat .
i mean , it is not sweet , it is not cute , i even dragged that little string on the ground , and it just flipped out and scratched the hell out of me .
and i swear , i know this sounds crazy , but every time this cat hisses at me i know it is saying , rachel !
does not sound as crazy as paying a thousand dollars for a cat .
what ?
!
you paid a thousand dollars for a cat when you owe me 300 !
!
well , i was going to let you play with it .
hi !
hmm , did you talk to gary about the moving in thing ?
yes i did , and i think you should do it .
what ?
!
he is a great guy , y'know ?
and he loves you a lot , you are a very lucky lady .
you are useless !
freaking out about commitment is the one thing you can do !
the one thing !
and you can not even do that right !
god !
i m sorry .
if you ask me , I would move in with him .
ohh !
!
god !
ooh !
get out of here , good for nothing .
hey gar !
yeah !
okay .
thanks !
okay .
yeah ?
uh hmm .
no that is not true .
if you are not moving forward , you are just staying still .
and staying still is good .
watch this .
yeah ?
that is so sweet .
but do not you think it is a little too soon ?
i mean there is so much we do not know about each other .
i just i do not want us to jump into something we are not ready for .
i really do not want to mess up what we have .
I am just I am worried it is going to be a big mistake .
which is why my answer is yes !
uh huh !
I am so happy .
monica !
stop throwing it so hard !
we are on the same team !
four hours ?
you guys have been doing this for four hours ?
that is right baby .
all right , let me in .
no no !
do not do it !

what ?
he is a dropper !
oh yeah , that is right !
I am not a dropper !
it is really a uh uh three person game , y'know ?
it is throwing and catching !
all right .
oh !
oh !
that is so hard .
whoa whoa you guys , it is not a cat !
oh my oh good god !
i give up you guys , i do not know what I am going to do with this thing !
baking it did not help , huh ?
so , why do not you just take it back to where you got it ?
i tried !
they will not take her back .
maybe that is because she is a minion of the anti christ .
rach , why will not they take it back ?
well , they said would but they would only give me store credit .
i mean , what am i going to do , get a thousand regular cats ?
look , if you want you can keep it at our place until you find out what to do with it .
no mon that is not the point .
I am out a thousand dollars , I am all scratched up , and I am stuck with this stupid cat that looks like a hand !
oh my god , the cat's made my eyes water !
do not do not throw it to me !
my vision's been compromised !
!
oh god !
okay .
okay .

we are moving in together !
is not it great !
yay !
i know , I am so excited !
well , you are not more excited than i am !
no way !
I am the most excited !
okay , yeah , I will see you later !
do not forget about the moving in !
so you are moving in with him .
what happened ?
i could not tell him no .
he got so sad .
maybe it will be all right .
i do really like him a lot and probably do it eventually anyway and plus , think of all the money I will save on stamps .
why , do you write him a lot ?
no , i just heard when people live together , they split the cost of stamps .
do not they ?
oh , I am sorry , the oven mitts really freaked me out .
no , nothing .
yeah .
no , as soon as something opens up we will move right in .
unless it does not have a pool , i need a pool .
uh huh !
yeah , i feel great .
because we are moving in together .

that will be $2,000 .

oh my god !
i had the best time with tim last night .
he is so sweet !
oh , i can t wait to get sous neath him .
i i have to fire him .
but why ?
!
because he s terrible !
okay , he s slow , he burns things , last night he lit my pastry chef on fire !
well maybe he was just nervous , y know you can be very intimidating .
and besides i ve met your pastry chef and she can stand to be taken down a peg or two .
well , now she has no eyebrows , mission accomplished .
but monica , he loves his job so much !
can you just give him another chance ?
please ?
all right , but if if he lights someone else on fire he is out of there !
that s fair !
thank you so much .
thanks .
oops , it looks like when he got the pastry chef he got you a little bit too .
i paid to have this done .
love it !
hey !
hi !
oh you know uh kash , really liked you the other day .
he said he thought you were charming .
i thought i was a complete idiot .
hey , i m with you .
he even asked me if i thought you d go out with him .
oh !
oh , i think i m going to throw up a little bit .
what did you say ?
i said no .
what ?
!
what ?
i i just figured since you re pregnant you re not going to be seeing people .
okay joey , first of all kash ford is not people .
second of all , what did he say when you told him i was pregnant ?
i didn t tell him .
i didn t know if you were telling people .
this is back when i thought kash was still people .
good good , don t tell him .
don t tell him .
just have him call me okay ?
rach look , i really don t think that s such a great  okay , you go do it !
i ll come back to that set !
i ll meet more actors !
i ll meet  them all !
hey bob .
if i see him , i ll ask .
yeah !
we re on a semi first name basis .
bob ?
ooh , working here with us ?
everyday ?
yeah , i don t know if he has what it takes .
but this is eleven .
it s almost twice as hard up here .
i think it s best sir .
y know what you should do , just toss  them in the shedder and claim you never got  them .
what does a guy have to do to be taken seriously around here ?
!
hey !
hey .
okay , i gave him another chance , but tim has got to go !
but  no !
no no !
he is totally incompetent .
i called the chef who recommended him to me .
he said , ha ha !
gotcha !
okay .
okay , but you can t fire him today .
why not ?
!
because i m dumping him today .
what ?
!
you said he was sweet !
he is sweet .
he s too sweet .
he calls me all the time .
so did did you get home from work okay ?
did did you get out of the shower okay ?
just don t pick up your phone .
then he comes over !
i m so worried about you .
uck !
be a man !
what ?
so now i m not allowed to fire him ?
you can t fire him and dump him the same day , he ll kill himself .
okay well then , i ll fire him today and you go out with him for another week .
are you kidding ?
!
another week with that sip , i ll kill myself !
okay well , then we ll both do it today and he ll just have to deal with it !
okay .
but the question is who s going to go first .
because whoever goes second is the bitch .
what do you mean ?
come on !
the boss that fires a guy that s just been dumped , bitch !
and the woman who dumps a guy that s just been fired , blond bitch !
i wanted to do this days ago so i think i should go first .
all right , that makes sense .
ugh .
but screw you i m going first !
sure , what s up ?
hey , what do you think is a better excuse for why i m not drinking on this date tonight .
umm , i m a recovering alcoholic .
i m a mormon ,  or i got so hammered last night i m still a little drunk ?
hey !
hi !
hey !
so , what do you want to do tonight ?
there s a ukrainian film at the angelica that s supposed to be very powerful .

but i ll go see a normal person movie with ya .
rach ?
you want to come ?
oh no , i can t .
i got a date .
a date ?
yeah .
why ?
is that weird for you ?
why no , it s the opposite of weird .
it s it s uh , regular .
it s it s uh , it s mundane .
it s actually uh , a little dull .
it s no ukrainian film .
yeah ooh !
earrings !
a date ?
!
she s she s got a date ?
!
with who ?
i set her up with this actor on my show .
you set her up ?
!
no joey what what were you thinking ?
!
well , i was thinking that it d probably be okay because ross hasn t gone out with rachel in five years !
joey , i m not worried about her !
i m worried about my baby !
whoever she dates my baby dates !
now now where is this  actor taking them ?
hey !
i m an  actor too !
i m not sure .
i think they re taking the ferry out to some italian place on staten island .
a ferry ?
my baby is going on a ferry ?
do you have any idea how dangerous those are ?
!
are we talking about one of those big boats that carry cars that go like five miles an hour ?
why don t they just jump out of an airplane ?
!
huh ?
!
that that s a fun date !
or burn each other with matches ?
!
that s fun too !
whew !
!
hey kash .
uh hey hey this is ross .
ross , this is kash .
hi .
i i hear you re going on a ferry tonight .
a bit of a daredevil are we ?
hey guys do you think this is too slutty hi kash !
yeah !

okay .
have a great time you guys .
thank you .
yes it is too slutty !
hi .

i know what that is .
you can stay .
so what movie do you want to see and not another one i have to read .
okay ?
i get enough of that from books .
books ?
all right , car magazines , cereal boxes , but it s like enough !
well , i tell you what .
why don t we uh , why don t we just stay here ?
let s not see a movie , we ll just hang .
and just wait for rachel to come back from her date ?
hey , if that s what you want to do i m not going to say no .
dude !
what is going on ?
!
i just i have to find out how it went .
why ?
this guy could be my baby s stepfather !
they go on one date and you re worried about them getting married ?
!
he s not you !
i just i i can t believe she s she s dating ?
!
well ross , what did you think she was going to do ?
i don t know !
i guess i just can t believe any of this is happening .
what do you mean ?
it s just i always thought when i had another kid it would be different .
now i i love ben , but every time i have to drop him off at carol and susan s , it s like it breaks my heart a little .
i mean i ve always had this picture of me and my next wife in bed on sunday and , my kid comes running in and leaps up onto the bed .
and we all read the paper together .
y know ?
maybe fight over the science section .
that s a nice picture .
maybe you can still have that !
no !
no i can t .
i mean rachel s out with some guy .
my baby went with her .
if anything that picture keeps moving further away .
hey , can i ask you something ?
in this , in this picture of you and your wife , is your wife rachel ?
it used to be .
now she doesn t really have a face .
smokin  body though .
good call .
yeah .
but , the face ross , the face isn t rachel .
no but ahh !
how much easier would it be if it were ?
i know , but i don t think that s what she wants .
no , it s not what i want either .
i mean i i can t force myself to fall in love with her again now .
that s okay ross maybe you need a new picture .
okay ?
it s not going to be what you thought , but no matter what there s going to be a brand new little baby , your baby .
who cares what the picture looks like ?
yeah .
hey , i tell you what .
let s you and me go out and have some fun .
huh ?
whatever you want .
come on !

.
sit down , sit down .
oh , honey , you know , i once also almost married somebody that i didn t love .
do you remember barry ?

you re so generous and kind and  you are amazing in bed   it s our anniversary !
oh how lame .
.
.
oh , it s so tacky , and impersonal .
oh , it s the worst way to propose !
hey , finished my recommendation .
here .
and i think you ll be very , very happy .
it s the longest i ever spent on a computer without looking at porn .
i don t .
.
.
uh .
.
.
understand .
some of the words are a little too sophisticated for ya ?
it doesn t make any sense .
of course it does !
it s smart !
i used the the saurus !
on every word ?
yep !
alright , what was this sentence originally ?
oh ,  they are warm , nice , people with big hearts  .
and that became  they are humid prepossessing homo sapiens with full sized aortic pumps .
.
.
?
yeah , yeah and hey , i really mean it , dude .
hey joey , i don t think we can use this .
why not ?
well , because you signed it baby kangaroo tribbiani  .
hey , why don t you stop worrying about sounding smart and just be yourself !
you know what ?
you don t need a thesaurus , just write from here ,  your full sized aortic pump .
amy , hi !
oh , good for you !
yes you are !
oh , i am so proud of you !
but erin brockovich had her own house .
ah , look who s back !
why do you have bags ?
rach , why does she have bags ?
what ?
you slept out here ?
yeah .
.
.
amy kept kicking me in her sleep yelling  myron , get off !
but uhm , we are getting rid of her , right ?
rach , please tell me we re getting rid of her .
joey , i can t do that !
oh , come on !
last night i was finishing off a pizza and she said  uoh oh oh , a moment on the lips , forever on the hips !
i don t need that kind of talk in my house !
well joey , uhm look , i know that she s difficult , but i think it s really good that she s here .
because we will appreciate it more when she s gone ?
no , it is just .
.
.
look , you know , when i first moved to the city i was a lot like her !
i was spoiled , self centered and you guys really took care of me .
yeah , monica made us !
well , uhm .
.
.
whatever , i have really appreciated it , because i don t think i would be the person that i am today if it wasn t for you guys .
see , i want to help amy the way you guys helped me .
and i know it s going to take patience , but that s ok .
yeaah .
amy , that s what i was supposed to wear today , that s why i hung it on the door .
amy , you know what ?
i was thinking that maybe now it would be a good time for us to sit down and , you know , talk about your future .
i m curvy , and i like it !
hi .
i just had the worst anniversary ever .
i doubt that !
tell her about us last year .
oh , well , i bought chandler a five hundred dollar watch and he wrote me a rap song .
seriously ?
word !
well , mine was worse than that .
well , what happened ?
we were at the game , and this guy proposed to his girlfriend on the big screen thing .
.
.
oh , that is so tacky .
well , that s what i said , but it turns out , mike was planning on proposing to me that same way last night !
oh my god , mike was going to propose ?
phoebe , that s huge !
well , do you want to marry him ?
yeah , i really do !
yes , but , after i dumped on the way he was going to propose to me , i don t think he s ever going to ask again !
i mean , i said no in barbados and now this !
she is right !
if i were a guy and .
.
.
did i just say if i were a guy .
.
?
maybe you do not need him to propose to you , maybe you can propose to him !
oh , i do not know , i do not know , is not that a little desperate ?
i proposed to chandler !
alright , moving on .
.
.
oh , i do not think it was desperate , i think it was amazing !
thank you .
well , do you think i should propose ?
i think it could be kind of great !
absolutely !
you will love the feeling !
there is nothing like it !
ok , ok , so how should i do it ?
how about at a game , on the big screen ?
uuuh !
!
how about at a footlocker ?
what ?
what ?
he obviously thinks that is a nice way to be proposed to , plus he would never suspect it !
yeah , that does make sense .
ok , now , would .
.
.
would you two  like that ?
sounds good to me .
.
.
but what would a guy think ?
oh !
that is interesting , since she died seven years ago !
!
hello ?
oh , it is our nanny !
hi !
oh .
.
.
god !
i hope you feel better !
ok , bye !
that is molly , she is sick .
can you watch emma today ?
no , i can not .
i have back to back classes .

because my throat's been hurting ?
menstrual cramps .
i do not think that is what this is .
can any of you watch emma ?
no , sorry sweety .
.

well , actually .
.

.
.
the next one ?

she just offered to do something for another human being !
!
i .
.
.
i do not know .
.
ross , I am telling you , she is giving up getting her eyebrows  shaped to do this alright ?
do you understand how important that is in our world ?
absolutely .
hey joe !
how is the second draft of the letter coming ?
great , I am finished !
in fact , i just dropped it off at the agency .
you dropped it off ?
yeah .
can we read it ?
can you print out another copy ?
no can do amigo .
no , i did not use the computer .
felt more personal to hand write it .
you hand wrote it ?
yeah , and do not worry .
i did not try to sound smart at all !
see ya later !
oh my god , oh my god , that letter is going to go in our file !
we are never going to get a kid .
no , we are going to be one of those old couples that collects orchids or has a lot of birds !
it is ok , it is ok .
you know what ?
I will just call the agency and tell them to throw out the letter .

i was just i was just reading to emma .
yeah , yeah .
.

climax your way to better skin  .
so you need someone who knows fashion , to tell you what looks good .
not me , not me , not me , not me , not me !
oh hey rach !
yeah .
.
.
maybe you could take charlie shopping .
oh , well .
.
.
are you kidding ?
rachel loves to shop !
and she has great taste !
yeah , she is the one who taught me , you do not wear white after labour day and that you always , always , always have to put on underwear when you are trying on clothes .
ok , uh uh .
.
.
let us let us shop !
!
ok , you are going to come back with some very classy clothes .
.
.
.
.
.
and some slutty lingerie , slutty !
ok , great !
all right , bye !
pain in the ass !
!
that is off , right ?
what is the matter , pheebs ?
oh .
.
.
mike's sister just invited me to a party tonight , he is going to be there .
and she was like oh , do not worry !
i asked him .
he is totally ok with seeing you !
.
so now i have to go so he will think that I am totally ok with seeing him !
which you are not , because you have totally hung up on him !
exactly !
and you are going to want him to eat his heart out so you are going to have to look fabulous !
i did not even think about that !
aaargh , sexual politics !
!
hey pheebs , I am I am taking charlie shopping , why do not you come and I will help you find something .
ok , that will be great !
oh , are not that nice ?
the three of you trying on slutty lingerie together .
that is not what we are going to do !
why would you ruin it , who was that hurtin ' ?
wow !
fortunately she has a very pretty face !
oh , i so can not believe this !
my uterus is an inhospitable environment ?
i was trying so hard to be a good hostess !
oh , i can not believe my sperm have low motility because , let me tell you , when i was growing up they sure seem to be in a hurry to get places !
!
hi .
hi .
ok .
oh , damn it !
do not worry , after a while he will tune it out .
ok .
is that a hint ?
because we love you doctor connelly but we do not think we would want you to be our child !
wow , talking about an inhospitable environment !
hi !
ok , you are ready to go pick up phoebe and go shopping ?
alright , have a good time .
not going to find any clothes in there !
hey , you guys !
hi .
guess who is up for keynote speaker at the national paleontology conference ?
yeah , right !
what was last time he met a submission deadline for an abstract  well , why are you laughing ?
just .
.
.
seeing what it would be like to be a paleontologist .
.
.
it is fun , yeah !
professor sherman , yeah .
I have a meeting with him today .
yeah , well .
.
.
i think i know how to dazzle him .
oh .
.
.
you are not going to do a magic trick , are ya ?
tsz .
.
.
no !
.
hey guys !
wait a minute , you guys .
oh , i want to ask you something .
i i i may get to speak at this paleontology convention and if i do , I would love for you guys to come and hear me .
i think i can safely say that we all have family issues , work stuff and/or are sick .
it is in barbados .
but you come first !
I am there !
bye .
bye , see ya .
ok .
all right , so .
how did it go at the fertility clinic ?
not as much fun as last time .
apparently you only get porn if you are giving a sperm sample .
so so what did the doctor say ?
well .
.
.
there is surrogacy , but monica has dreamt her whole life of carrying a child , she has felt that watching a surrogate would be .
.
.
too hard for her .
so you are ruling out surrogacy ?
yeah .
so , i do not have to learn what that means ?
aside from adoption the only other choice is insemination , so .
.
.
we are talking about sperm donors .
enough said , I am there for you man .
where is she , upstairs ?
ah ha !
how do you feel about all this ?
i wish there was an easier way for us to have a child but i do not think there is one .
come on ross , be a good guy .
step up and do it !
what ?
what ?
no !
i am not going to give them ben !
the data we are receiving from mri scans and dna testing of these fossils are    are staggering .
i mean , we have been accepting leakey's dates as a given , but if they are off by even a hundred thousand years or so then you can    you can just throw most of our assumptions , you know , right in the trash .
so so what i am saying is    is is that  is that the repercussions could be huge !
i mean , not just in palaeontology , but if if you think about it , in evolutionary biology , uh , genetics , geology , uh , i mean , truly the mind boggles !
oh , that is not what you want .
.
.
oh , I will take some of that .
pheebs , that is for men !
no , i know , this way when i go to the party later mike will know i am over him because I am going to smell like another guy .
yeah .
ok .
oh good , I am dating a russian cab driver .
.
seriously does anyone buy this ?
i smell like beets !
on melanie griffith in working girl  .
i think what you want is over here .
really ?
oh , i can not .
because i I have seen them .
yeah !
I am a big fan !
of the movies , you know .
motion pictures .
the talkies !
hey rach , will you come with me to a dressing room ?
sure !
ok !
you know that depends on what it is !
I have done a lot of stuff .
so what were you doing out there , do you not like charlie ?
she is ok , i just do not get a really good vibe from her !
why ?
i do not know , you know , just the way she waltzed in here all smart , and tall !
you know , and just swept joey off his feet .
.
.
i mean , nobody else has a chance !
who else ?
anybody !
you , me , you know , monica's mom .
.
.
you like joey ?
shhhhh !
phoebe !
all right , look .
i have a little thing for him .
oh my god !
it is just physical and i have it totally under control !
ok ?
it is just , when i see them together , sometimes i just get a little jealous !
uh , wow !
is not it ironic that he liked you and now you like him ?
oh , i get it !
oh well , as long as it is under control , you know , you can not do anything about it , he is already dating her , and she is a nice person , that would not be right .
i know , i know , so it is just not a big deal .
yeah .
so can we keep this between us ?
sure !
ok , great , because i got to get out of here , the smell of beets is killing me !
oh .
any chance charlie has a deaf twin ?
hi honey !
hey !
look i brought a friend for dinner , this is zack , from work !
oh , of course , it is so nice to see you again , zack !
you guys have not actually met before , but , boy !
you are both polite !
go to have a seat zack , and I will get you a beer .
i got it .
so , zack's pretty nice , uh ?
yeah , i guess .
so , how would you like to have a baby that is half yours and half his !
excuse me ?
well , we are talking about sperm donors and zack may be the guy !
i mean , look , he is intelligent , he is healthy , he is athletic , i mean , he is spermtastic  !
chandler , this is crazy !
what did you even say to him !
come up , meet my wife !
give us your sperm  !
no , i invited him to dinner so you could get a chance to get to know him !
i mean , if we go through a sperm bank you never meet the guy , get to check him out .
chandler !
I am telling you , he is great !
i mean , even if my sperm worked fine , I would think he would be the way to go !
I am not going to be a part of this !
you can not just bring some random guy at home and expect him to be our sperm donor !
ok !
uh !
zack !
tell me about yourself , zack !
oh , god , do you think she heard ?
it would be so bad if she heard !
well , maybe she did not hear !
ok I am going to go into that dressing room , you stay in here and I will talk and see if you can hear me .
ok , great !
oh , thank god i can not hear a word that you are saying !
i did not say anything yet !
well , get back in there and talk !
I am rachel .
it is so annoying when i put emma on the phone to talk with my friends .
what !
?
well , some things are just hard to say to your face .
ok well , i heard that !
which means that she heard it too !
ooh !
we have a problem .
oh !
what are we going to do ?
oh my god !
alright !
enough out of you !
hello ?
joey !
hey , i need to talk to charlie .
is she there ?
no .
no .
.
.
eh .
.
.
she went shopping with rachel .
why ?
what is up ?
I am meeting with professor sherman about my being the keynote speaker .
.
.
oh !
how is it going ?
it could be better !
he , uhm .
.
.
he fell asleep !
what !
?
but i already bought my ticket to bermuda !
barbados .
fine , I will rent a car and drive .
.
.
!
ross , you have to get that job !
what am i supposed to do ?
he is out cold !
in fact he was just talking in his sleep before and evidently he wants someone named fran to spank him harder .
well , just wake him up !
i can not !
if he realizes that I am the one that put him to sleep , i will not get the job !
uh !
that is a tough one .
oh !
wait a minute , this happened to me before !
yeah , i was auditioning for a play and the producer fell asleep and .
.
.
no wait a minute .
.
.
it was me who fell asleep .
.
.
yeah i mean hey , shakespeare , how about a chase scene once in a while !
?
hey guys !
dinner's ready !
so what do you think ?
i want that guys genes for my kid !
those eyes , those cheeckbones !
ok , there is enthusiastic and there is just plain gay !
!
you do not like him .
i think he is fine !
it is just that we do not know anything real about him .
.
.
we should get more information .
alright !
just follow my lead !
oh !
thanks , I am crazy about our place .
hey !
speaking of crazy .
.
.
do you have a history of mental illness in the family ?
that is really not the kind of thing we are looking for zack .
oh , friends first , drunk in london , you know the story .
I have got a better question for you : do you or any of your blood relatives have diabetes ?
eh .
.
.
heart disease , alzheimers , gout ?
we are just making conversation .
you know what is not funny ?
male pattern baldness  i noticed you were enjoying that ravioli with a beautiful set of teeth .
did you have braces as a child ?
yess !
!
we are teeth people zack !
alright !
let us just do it .
let us just go over there and see if she heard .
good plan .
ok .
wha .
.
.
?
where ?
where are you going ?
oh !
I am sorry rachel , i do not have time for your childish games , ok ?
i still have to go find something incredible to wear so i can beat mike at who is more over who  !
hey , hi !
hey , where have you been ?
oh !
wi .
.
.
in the dres .
.
.
in the dressing room !
?
well , that is so weird !
phoebe and i were just trying on clothes in the dressing room .
god it is just such a small world !
oh god .
you did .
you heard .
ok , listen , let me explain .
yeah .
yeah !
that is phoebe .
that is phoebe .
you know , she just wants them all !
it is like she is a nympho !
yeah .
.
.
i try .
.
.
oh my god !
you really want me to be the keynote speaker ?
thank you !
wow !
you look .
.
.
.
.
.
stop eating hot !
which is like the highest level of hotness !
are you sure ?
because I am really dreading going to this party .
then do not go !
mike knows I am coming , and if i do not show up he will think it is because of him !
and i do not want to lose face !
that is a very serious thing in my culture .
alright , then you go to that party and you pretend to be over mike .
and afterward you come to my place and I will get you good and drunk !
you got it !
ok .
but not on the wine that you made , ok , because i just do not want to go back to the emergency room .
david ?
oh my god !
yeah .
what what are you doing here ?
what happened ?
yeah ?
well , it is great that you are back !
how are you ?
good !
oh , good for you .
mike and i broke up .
really ?
i understand .
yeah .
ok so then ok , so we are both living in new york , not seeing anyone .
that is so not like us !
well .
.
.
no .
I would love to .
ok .
oh , got it , stay upwind of me .
no , that is david .
tip of the iceberg .
you sure you do not want to stick around a little longer ?
are you just tired now or are you always tired , because that could be a sign of clinical depression .
ok .
i think we have found our sperm !
does seem pretty perfect .
yeah , you think so , well ?
should i ask him ?
no .
why not , just because his great grandmother was obese , our kids are going to get that from you anyway !
no , that is not it .
it is just that when we were asking him all those questions before , i just .
.
.
i just realized i do not care if he is the most perfect guy in the world .
.
.
he is not you .
yeah , he is better !
no , he is not .
and if i can not get pregnant with you , then i do not want to get pregnant by .
.
.
him or anyone else .
really ?
are you sure ?
yeah , I am sure .
thank god , because i do not want to do this either .
you know , i was just doing because i thought that was what you wanted to do .
you know , I am the husband , I am supposed to .
.
.
bring the sperm .
that is so sweet .
i love you .
so you know this leaves us with .
.
.
adoption .
how do you feel about that ?
i think i feel ok about it .
actually i think i feel really good about it .
me too .
i want to find a baby that needs a home and i want to raise it with you .
and i want to mess it up in our own specific way .
so this is it , we are really going to adopt ?
yeah .
oh my god , we are going to be parents !
we are going to be great parents .
and it could be soon .
i mean , think about it : right now , somewhere out there  our baby could be being conceived .
wait , if we are lucky , and we are really really really quiet , we may be able to hear the sound of a condom breaking !
hey , zack !
look , i just wanted to apologize for last night .
i got the feeling we made you a little uncomfortable .
really ?
my wife and i have some boundary issues , you know , sometimes we ask inappropriate questions .
we are working on it .
you would not know if jeanette's planning on keeping her baby , would ya ?
hey , you re not going to believe this .
i made up a joke and sent it in to playboy .
they printed it !
i didn t know playboy prints jokes .
yeah , they print jokes , interviews , hard hitting journalism .
it s not just about the pictures .
that didn t work on mom , it s not going to work on us .
here , check it out .
it s the first one , too .
that is funny .
it was also funny when i made it up .
what ?
i made that joke up .
uh , oh oh , no you didn t .
i did .
yes , i did .
i told it to dan at work , and he said it was the funniest joke he d ever heard .
hey , tell dan ,  thanks .
what ?
i m sorry , i was just reading the joke below it .
man , that one is funny .
monica , you remember me telling you that joke , right ?
no .
seriously ?
well , you tell a lot of jokes !
look , chandler , it s my joke .
but , hey , if it makes you feel any better they don t print the name , so it doesn t really matter who gets credit , right ?
yeah , i guess .
hey guys .
hey , joey , playboy printed my joke .
no , it s my joke , it s mine .
you can call them , they ll tell you .
it s my joke .
it s my joke .
whoa whoa whoa .
jokes ?
you guys know they have naked chicks in there , right ?
dude , you have got to turn on behind the music .
the band heart is having a really tough time , and i think they may break up .
let s go watch it at your place .
nah , monica s watching some cooking show .
come on , i don t want to miss when they were skinny .
chandler , chandler , y know what we should do ?
you and i should go out and get some new sunglasses .
what ?
no , i want to watch this .
.
did your cable go out ?
no , that s vh 1 .
i got to tell you , the music these kids listen to today  .
.
.
it s like a lotta noise to me .
i don t know  joey , why is your cable out ?
i uh , oh !
because , uh , i haven t really paid the bill if you need money , will you please please just let me loan you some money ?
no , chandler .
look , forget about it , okay ?
look , i know things have been a little tight since janine moved out .
oh , was she hot .
whoa ho .
i know !
yeah , but , look i can handle it .
all right ?
look , i can listen to the radio , huh ?
and ross gave me this great book  .
all right , you want to see if the joke stealer will let us watch the show at his place ?
sure .
paid your phone bill ?
not so much .
hey .
it s only you .
wh wh what are you doing ?
we are looking at a playboy .
oh , i want to look too !
.
yikes !
so do you think that these pictures are , are they trying to tell a story ?
oh , yeah , sure .
i mean , like in the case of this young woman , she has lost her clothes , so she rides naked on the horse , she s crying out ,  where are they , where are they ?
well , she s not going to find them lying in the grass like that .
oh , yeah .
aw , remember the days when you used to go out to the barn , lift up your shirt , and bend over ?
you see , now , i would date this girl .
she s cute , she s outdoorsy , you know , and she knows how to build a fire .
i mean , that s got to come in handy okay , i ve got a question .
if you had to pick one of us to date , who would it be ?
i don t know .
me neither .
rachel .
what ?
!
i don t know .
me neither .
you forget how many great songs heart had .
yeah .
you know , barracuda was the first song i learned to play on the keyboard .
so , you heard it , you repeated it , so that must mean you wrote it .
oh , you guys , with this joke .
i got to say , i know i cracked up , but i m not even sure i got it .
what , you didn t get it ?
the doctor is a monkey .
and monkeys can t write out prescriptions .
you are not allowed to laugh at my joke .
your joke ?
well , i think  the hef  would disagree , which is why he sent me a check for one hundred ah dollars .
so , you stole my joke , and you stole my money .
well , i was going to stick it in the atm , but now i think i ll show the sexy teller that i am a published writer .
well , she is going to know that you stole the joke .
oh , what are you going to do , follow me down there ?
yeah !
well , i m not going to go now anyway  .
okay  .
ah , gunther , i can t pay for this right now because i m not working , so i ve had to cut down on some luxuries like uh , payin  for stuff .
uh , i don t know .
ya see , it s just , see i was a regular on a soap opera y know ?
and to go from that to this , i just  plus , i d have to wait on all my friends .
what ?
!
maybe i could be a waiter .
could i use the phone ?
she picked rachel .
i mean , she tried to back out of it , but it was obvious .
she picked rachel .
he took my joke , he took it .
it s wrong .
you know what else is wrong ?
phoebe picking rachel .
you know who else picked rachel ?
ross , and you know what else ross did ?
he stole my joke .
you know what ?
i m going to get a joke journal .
y know ?
and document the date and time of every single one of my jokes .
that s a good idea .
yeah !
do you know what s a bad idea ?
picking rachel .
that s right .
did you hear something ?
maybe it s the sound of ross climbing into my brain and stealing my thoughts .
it s coming from the living room .
i finished my book .
hey , you guys .
oh , don t you guys look cute .
you guys make such a cute couple .
monica , what are you doing ?
nothing , i m just trying to recreate some of the fun that we had at my place the other day .
remember , when you picked rachel over me ?
that was funny .
i guess it was kind of funny .
it wasn t funny at all !
why would you do that ?
why didn t you pick me ?
fine .
the reason that i was leaning a little bit more toward rachel than you is just that you re   just   kind of high maintenance okay let s go to lunch !
that is completely untrue .
you think i m high maintenance ?
okay , prove it .
i want you to make a list and we re going to go through it point by point !
no , okay , you re right .
you re easy going .
you re just not as easy going as rachel .
she s just more flexible and and mellow .
that s all .
well , people are different .
ya , you know , rachel   she ll do whatever you want .
y know , you can just walk all over her .
what ?
wait a minute .
what are you saying , that i m a pushover ?
i m not a pushover .
oh , okay ,  you re not a pushover .
oh my   you think i m a pushover .
well wait , watch this , you know what ?
you re not invited to lunch .
what do you think of that ?
i think that s pretty strong , that s what i think .
come on , monica , let s go to lunch .
you start working on that list .
i cannot believe her .
i know .
where do you want to go eat ?
oh , oh , i love that japanese place .
i m sick of japanese .
we re not going there .
all right , wherever you want to go is cool .
all right .
oh , hey , gunther , check this out .
hey ross , listen , you want anything to drink ,  because i m heading up there .
uh , yeah , i ll take a coffee .
thanks , man .
sure .
coffee ?
because i m going up there .
no .
no , thank you .
you guys need anything ,  because i m heading up there .
you got it .
joey , what are you doing ?
just being friendly .
joey , honey , i don t think you re supposed to go back there .
nah , it s okay .
right , gunther ?
okay , but i don t see you asking any other paying customers to put on aprons .
joey , do you work here ?
no .
yeah ?
joey , what s going on .
what didn t you tell us you work here ?
it s kind of embarrassing , y know .
i mean , i was an actor and now i m a waiter .
it s supposed to go in the other direction .
so is your apron .
you re wearing it like a cape .
i mean , the job s easy and the money s good , you know ?
i guess i m going to be hanging out here anyway .
i might as well get paid for it , right ?
i just feel kind of weird serving you guys .
come on , joey , i did it and it was fine .
yeah , why would it be weird ?
hey , joey , can i get some coffee ?
okay , i guess it doesn t seem that weird .
seriously , i i asked you before and you still haven t gotten it .
see , now it s weird again .
i think it s great that you work here .
you re going to make a lot of money , and here s your first tip : don t eat yellow snow .
.
ah ha ha , 2:15 , coffeehouse .
well , you know what ?
this is great .
finally , i have someone i can pass on my wisdom too .
let me tell you about a couple of things i learned while working at the coffeehouse .
first of all , the customer is always right .
a smile goes a long way .
and if anyone is ever rude to you ?
sneeze muffin .
thanks , rach .
look , you guys are just terrific .
y know ?
now , how about clearing out of here so i can get some new customers .
it s all about turnover .
joey , seriously , can i get my coffee ?
oh , i m sorry , ross .
i ll get it for you right now .
and since i made you wait , i ll toss in a free muffin .
phoebe .
we would like to talk to you for a second .
okay .
so , maybe i am a little high maintenance .
and maybe rachel is a little bit of a pushover .
but you know what we decided you are ?
yes , we are very sorry to tell you this , but you , phoebe , are flaky .
hah !
that true , i am flaky .
so , what , you re just , you re just okay with being flaky ?
yeah , totally .
well , then , i m okay with being high maintenance .
yeah , and i am okay with being a pushover .
that s great .
good for you guys .
i am not high maintenance !
i am not a pushover !
who said you were ?
oh , i m flaky .
i ll say anything .
hey , gunther .
can you uh , can you cover for me ?
i just got an audition .
really ?
!
i like your natural color .
come on man , it s a great part .
look , check it out .
i m the lead guy s best friend and i wait for him in this bar and save his seat .
listen listen .
i m sorry , that seat s saved .
okay , maybe he s not his best friend , but   oh , man , i could totally get that part .
i m sorry , that seat is taken .
no , no , i didn t mean you .
but , you believed me , huh ?
so , you d hire me , right ?
exactly !
all right , everybody , listen up .
the coffeehouse is going to be closed for about an hour .
yeah , it s for the kids .
to keep the kids off drugs .
it s a very important issue in this month s playboy .
i m sure you all read about it .
it s my joke .
it s my joke .
y know , i don t think we re going to settle this .
let s have monica decide .
yeah !
yeah !
hey mon .
mon , get out here !
monica !
okay , okay .
you have to help us decide whose joke this is .
why do i have to decide ?
because you re the only one that can be fair .
yeah .
i can t be fair .
you re my boyfriend .
yeah , but i m your brother .
we re family .
that s the most important thing in the world .
don t try to sway her .
i m your only chance to have a baby .
okay , let s go .
we ll each tell you how we came up with the joke and then you decide which one of us is telling the truth me .
okay , chandler , you go first .
okay , i thought of the joke two months ago at lunch with steve .
oh , wait , is he the guy i met at christmas ?
can i finish my story ?
!
do you want me to pick you ?
!
see , i would never snap at you like that .
continue .
so steve said he had to go to the doctor .
and steve s doctor s name is doctor muppy .
so i said ,  doctor monkey ?
and that is how the whole doctor monkey thing came up .
are you kidding ?
okay , look .
i i studied evolution .
remember , evolution ?
monkey into man ?
plus , i m a doctor , and i had a monkey .
i m doctor monkey !
i m not arguing with that .
all right , i ve heard enough .
i ve made my decision .
you are both idiots .
the joke is not funny , and it s offensive to women , and doctors , and monkeys !
you shouldn t be arguing over who gets credit , you should be arguing over who gets blamed for inflicting this horrible joke upon the world !
now let it go !
the joke sucks !
it s your joke .
is not .
hi , chandler .
there you are .
hi , oh hi .
hey , it s phoebe and rachel .
um , why don t you tell them what you were telling me earlier about me not being high maintenance ?
monica is a self sufficient , together lady .
being with her has been like being on a vacation .
and what may be perceived as high maintenance is merely attention to detail and generosity of spirit .
wow , you know what ?
that is the best fake speech i think i ve ever heard .
really ?
i ve heard better .
wait , wait , he came up with that himself .
tell them , chandler .
i m out of words .
should i just say the whole thing again ?
look , i am not high maintenance .
i am not .
chandler !
you re a little high maintenance .
ahhh !
you are on my list .
i m sorry .
you re not easy going , but you re passionate , and that s good .
and when you get upset about the little things , i think that i m pretty good about making you feel better about that .
and that s good too .
so , they can say that you re high maintenance , but it s okay , because i like   maintaining you .
i didn t even tell him to say that .
.
all right you re off my list .
i m off the list .
phoebe , it s okay that you don t want me to be your girlfriend because i have the best boyfriend .
y know , suddenly i find you very attractive .
hey , buddy boy , how d the audition go ?
not good , no .
i didn t get the part , and i lost my job here , so   wow !
that is a bad audition .
how how did you lose your job here ?
well , i had the audition but gunther said i had to stay here and be in charge so he could go get his hair dyed .
so , i went anyway , and then he fired me .
he left work in the middle of the day to do a personal errand and left you in charge when you ve been working here two days ?
that s not , that s not right .
yeah , what are ya going to do ?
joey , you can t let him get away with that .
ya know what , i m not going to let him get away with that .
i m going to say something to him no , i really shouldn t say anything no , i should say something to him .
gunther , i want you to give joey his job back .
that is really not fair that you have to fire him  what ?
that s right , he can have his job back .
i m glad we got that all straightened out .
there you go , joey , you got your job back .
that s great .
thanks rach .
yeah , pretty nice , huh ?
now who s a pushover ?
rach , you re in my seat .
oh , i m sorry .
hey , i never got to hear who you guys would pick to be your girlfriend .
i pick you , phoebe .
oh , yeah .
definitely you , pheebs .
yeah , well , i kind of thought .
hey .
hey .
oh , i have a question .
if if if one of you had to pick one of the other two guys to go out with , who would you pick ?
no way .
i m not answering that .
joey !
no way .
i m not answering that .
guys ?
there is a somebody I would like you to meet .
w wait .
what is that ?
'that ' would be marcel .
you want to say hi ?
no , no , i do not .
oh , he is precious !
where did you get him ?
my friend bethel rescued him from some lab .
that is so cruel !
why ?
why would a parent name their child bethel ?
hey , that monkey's got a ross on its ass !
ross , is he going to live with you , like , in your apartment ?
yeah .
i mean , it is been kind of quiet since carol left , so .
.
.
why do not you just get a roommate ?
nah , i dunno .
.
.
i think you reach a certain age , having a roommate is kind of pathe     .
.
sorry , that is , that is 'pathet ' , which is sanskrit for 'really cool way to live ' .
so you guys , I am doing all new material tonight .
i have twelve new songs about my mother's suicide , and one about a snowman .
might want to open with the snowman .
so , how did it go ?
ahhhhhh , i did not get the job .
how could you not get it ?
you were santa last year .
i dunno .
some fat guy's sleeping with the store manager .
he is not even jolly , it is all political .
so what are you going to be ?
ah , I am going to be one of his helpers .
it is just such a slap in the face , y'know ?
hey , do you guys know what you are doing for new year's ?
gee , what ?
!
what is wrong with new year's ?
nothing for you , you have paolo .
you do not have to face the horrible pressures of this holiday : desperate scramble to find anything with lips just so you can have someone to kiss when the ball drops !
!
man , I am talking loud !
well , for your information , paolo is going to be in rome this new year , so I will be just as pathetic as the rest of you .
yeah , you wish !
it is just that I am sick of being a victim of this dick clark holiday .
i say this year , no dates , we make a pact .
just the six of us   dinner .
y'know , i was hoping for a little more enthusiasm .
phoebe , you are on .
oh , oh , good .
okay , hi .
ladies and gentlemen , back by popular demand , miss phoebe buffay .
wooh !
thanks , hi .
um , i want to start with a song that means a lot to me this time of year .
well , c'mon , if it is important enough to discuss while I am playing , then i assume it is important enough for everyone else to hear !
that guy's going home with a note !
could you speak up please ?
okay , we are going to take a short break .
hey , that guy's going home with more than a note !
come here , marcel .
sit here .
pheebs , i can not believe he has not kissed you yet .
i mean god , by my sixth date with paolo , i mean he had already named both my breasts !
.
ooh .
did i just share too much ?
just a smidge .
david's like , y'know , scientist guy .
he is very methodical .
i think it is romantic .
me too !
oh !
did you ever see an officer and a gentleman ?
yeah !
well , he is kind of like the guy i went to see that with .
except , except he he is smarter , and gentler , and sweeter .
.
.
i just   i just want to be with him all the time .
day and night , and night and day .
.
.
and special occasions .
.
.
wait a minute , wait a minute , i see where this is going , you are going to ask him to new year's , are not you .
you are going to break the pact .
she is going to break the pact .
no , no , no , no , no , no .
yeah , could i just ?
yeah , because i already asked janice .
what ?
!
c'mon , this was a pact !
this was your pact !
i snapped , okay ?
i could not handle the pressure and i snapped .
yeah , but janice ?
that that was like the worst breakup in history !
I am not saying it was a good idea , I am saying i snapped !
hi .
hi , sorry I am late .
too many jokes .
.
.
must mock joey !
nice shoes , huh ?
aah , y'killing me !
ross !
he is playing with my spatulas again !
okay , look , he is not going to hurt them , right ?
do you always have to bring him here ?
i did not want to leave him alone .
alright ?
we   we had our first fight this morning .
i think it has to do with my working late .
i said some things that i did not mean , and he   he threw some faeces .
.
.
y'know , if you are going to work late , i could look in on him for you .
oh , that would be great !
okay , but if you do , make sure it seems like you are there to see him , okay , and you are not like doing it as a favour to me .
okay , but if he asks , I am not going to lie .
okay , alright , i have a question , then .
um , were you planning on kissing me ever ?
sure .
oh , david , i , i think you are a sweeping sorta fella .
i mean , you are a sweeper !
.
trapped inside a physicist's body .
oh , yeah , oh , I am sure of it .
you should just do it , just sweep and throw me .
oh yeah , right now .
okay , now you are just kind of tidying .
i can hop .
so tell me something .
what does the phrase 'no date pact ' mean to you ?
I am sorry , okay .
it is just that chandler has somebody , and phoebe has somebody   i thought I would ask fun bobby .

oh , c'mon .
we will have , we will have a big party , and no one'll know who is with who .
hey , y'know , this is so not what i needed right now .
what is the matter ?
oh , it is it is marcel .
he keeps shutting me out , y'know ?
he is walking around all the time dragging his hands .
.

that is so weird , i had such a blast with him the other night .
really .
yeah , we played , we watched tv .
.
that juggling thing is amazing .
what , uh .
.
.

vividly .
hi .
sandy !

par tay !
that thing is not coming in here .
'that thing ' ?
this is how you greet guests at a party ?
let me ask you something , if i showed up here with my new girlfriend , she would not be welcome in your home ?
I am guessing your new girlfriend would not urinate on my coffee table .
okay .
he was more embarrassed about that than anyone .
okay ?
and for him to have the courage to walk back in here like nothing happened .
.
.
alright .
just keep him away from me .
thank you .
c'mon , marcel , whaddya say you and i do a little mingling ?
alright , I will , uh .
.

rachel , honey .
.
are you okay ?
where where is paolo ?
rome .
jerk missed his flight .
and then .
.
.
your face is bloated ?
no .
okay .
i was at the airport , getting into a cab , when this woman   this blonde planet with a pocketbook   starts yelling at me .
something about how it was her cab first .
and then the next thing i know she just starts   starts pulling me out by my hair !
so I am blowing my attack whistle thingy and three more cabs show up , and as I am going to get into a cab she tackles me .
and i hit my head on the kerb and cut my lip on my whistle .
oh .
everybody having fun at the party ?
are people eating my dip ?
wow , that is , uh , dirty .
hey , kids .
.
.
look at him .
I am not saying he has to spend the whole evening with me , but at least check in .
but you found me !
kill me .

hey everybody !

hey fun bobby !
whoah !
who died ?
alright , janice , that is it !

.
.
oh , will you give me the thing .
hi , max !
are you alright ?
you are going to minsk .
oh , you are so going to minsk .
you belong in minsk .
you can not stay here just because of me .
oh yes , yes , yes you can .
just say , um , 'phoebe , my work is my life and that is what i have to do right now ' .
and i say 'your work ?

.
and then you say , um , 'it is tearing me apart , but i have no choice .
can not you understand that ? '
.
and i say  'no !
no !
i can not understand that ! '
.
ooh , sorry .
um , and , and then you put your arms around me .
and then you put your arms around me .
and , um , and then you tell me that you love me and you will never forget me .
and then you say that it is almost midnight and you have to go because you do not want to start the new year with me if you can not finish it .
I am going to miss you .
you scientist guy .
there y'go , kids .
and then the peacock bit me .
please kiss me at midnight .

ooh .
uh , i do not know how to tell you this , but she is in monica's bedroom , getting it on with max , that scientist geek .
ooh , look at that , i did know how to tell you .
vrrbddy , the bll is drrbing .
the bll is drrbing !
and the moment of joy is upon us .
looks like that no date pact thing worked out .
everybody looks so happy .
i hate that .
not everybody's happy .
hey bobby !
y'know , i uh .
.
just thought I would throw this out here .
I am no math whiz , but i do believe there are three girls and three guys right here .
i dunno .
i do not feel like kissing anyone tonight .
i can not kiss anyone .

nonono , you can not kiss ross , that is your brother .

alrightalrightalright .
there .
i wanted this to work so much .
i mean I am still in there , changing his diapers , pickin ' his fleas .
.

but he is just phoning it in .
just so hard to accept the fact that something you love so much does not love you back .
.
i think that bitch cracked my tooth .
hey !
ready to go ?
oh yeah , let me just finish this .
hey ross , check this out !
yeah , i can not do that !
what are you doin ' ?
have you seen this ?
it is a new alumni website for college !
it is cool !
you can post messages for people , let everyone know what you are up to .
great , a faster way to tell people that I am unemployed and childless  .
it is actually kind of interesting to find out what people are doing .
.
.
remember andrea rich ?
the tall girl who would not sleep with you ?
uh uh .
.
.
well , her internet company went under and she lost an ear in a boating accident .
.
.
bet she would sleep with you now .
.
.
no .
.
.
i already e mailed her .
let me see what you wrote about yourself : doctor paleontology , two kids .
.
.
you split with carol because you have different interests ?
.
.
.
i think you split with carol because you have one very similar interest !
you know what ?
I am going to finish this later , ok ?
let me just grab my coat .
hey !
what do you think you learnt how to do in the last two minutes ?
?
maybe we finish this for him !
also i cloned a dinosaur in my lab .
she is now my girlfriend .
i do not care what society says .
it is the best sex I have ever had  .
.
.
aaand send !
no , no , no .
.
.

aaand send !
hey !
how was basketball ?
oh , it was a lot of fun right up until chandler got a finger in the eye !
oh , no !
who did that ?
chandler .
.
.
hey .
.
.
rach .
.
.

she was just crawling around and she found him , so i just let her sleep with him .
that is all right ?

oh , yeah .
.
.
of course .
.
.
yeah .
.
.
it is a stuffed animal .
.
.
you know .
.
.
it is for kids .
.
.
not for adults .
.
.
i know that !
joey .
.
.
are you sure ?
i mean , i know how much you love him !
rachel .
.
.
let us be clear on this , ok ?
i do not love hugsy .
i like him a normal amount .
.
.
all right .
.
.
oh , emma loves him !
why would not she ?
he is a wonderful person !
hi .
hey phoebe .
.
.
how you doin ' ?
you feelin ' better ?
breaking up sucks !
oh , i really miss mike !
oh , I am so sorry !
oh god , i tried everything to make myself feel better .
i even tried writing a song about it .
.
.
but .
.
.
i can not think of anything that rhymes with aarrgghh !
!
hey monica , i really need your help getting through this .
.
.
you are not going to need my help ?
well no , when i get to the point where .
.
.
you know .
.
.
I am ready to hear cruel mocking jokes about mike .
.
.
I am going to come to you .
oh good , because I have already thought of 3 .
.
.
4 !
I have just thought of a fourth  ok .
i mean i know i did the right thing .
you know , mike never wants to get married and i should not be in a relationship that has no future .
.
.
but .
.
.
pretty soon I am going to miss him so much .
I am going to want to see him again and you have to stop me from doing that .
ok , you got it !
unless .
.
.
maybe it is too crazy about this .
.
.
alright so .
.
.
you know , there is no future .
.
.
but that does not mean we still can not have fun .
you know what ?
forget what i said .
really ?
if that is what you want .
.
.
that was a test and you just failed .
damn it !
rookie mistake !
i have sex with dinosaurs ?
?
i believe i read that somewhere !
that only is not funny , it is physically impossible !
ok ?
depending on the species I would have to have a six foot long .
.
.
it is not funny !
!
i respectfully disagree .
i can not believe you put that on my alumni page !
who cares ?
nobody reads those things you would better hope not because i just read what you put on your page today .
i do not have a page .
oh oh oh !
i respectfully disagree !
!
look at you , all sweet and innocent , sleeping like an angel .
.
.
with emma's chubby little hands wrapped around ya .
it is okay , emma , you stay asleep .
: step away from the crib , i have a weapon !
it is okay , it is okay rach , it is me .
put down the scrunchy .
what are you doing ?
well , i heard emma stirring , so i came to make sure she could reach hugsy .
oh , oh thanks .
alright well , now that I am up I am going to go to the bathroom .
there you go sweetie .
.
.
this is not over .
alright , wait a second , why would ross tell everyone in your class that you are as .
.
.
gay as the day is long  ?
because i told everyone he slept with dinosaurs .
but that is clearly a joke .
this could easily be true .
would you get that please ?
people have been calling to congratulate me all day .
hello ?
no , he is not here .
yeah , this is his wife .
yeah , well , it came as quite a shock to me too .
i guess i should have known .
yeah , i mean , he just kept making me watch moulin rouge .
hang up , hang up .
and that was a great movie !
I am so going to get back at ross .
.
.
oh yeah , this will show him , here we go  .
what are you doing ?
oh , you will see my friend .
I am dead ?
and so young .
posting that i died ?
that really is not funny .
well , how you died was funny .
oh please , hit by a blimp ?
it kills over one americans every year .
unbelievable , my classmates are going to think I am dead , my professors , my .
.
.
my parents are going to get phone calls .
you are messing with people's feelings here .
you want to talk about people's feelings ?
you should have heard how hurt professor stern was yesterday when i told him i would not be able to go with him to key west !
you have really crossed the line here , but that is okay , it is ok because I am on my way to buy some photoshop software and a stack of gay porn .
that is right !
your coming out is about to get real graphic .
god , i wish mike were here .
okay if mike were here what would the two of you be doing ?
what are you , animals ?
it is 4 of the clock in the afternoon !
i got to call him .
just to talk to him , there is no harm in that .
phoebe , that is how it starts .
i do not need to eat the cake , I will just smell the icing .
.
.
why do not i just eat a little sliver , or , okay , just a slice or two .
and next thing you know , you are 210 pounds and you get wedged in going down the tunnel slide .
phoebe , honey , i know this is hard .
look , if you talk to him , you are going to want to see him .
and if you see him , you are going to want to get back together with him .
i know that is not what you want .
give me your phone .
here .
and now your cell .
okay  this is your cellphone ?
yes .
this is your current cellphone ?
yes , it reminds me of a simpler time .
phoebe , where is your purse ?
no , no !
give it to me !
you can not have it .
give it to me !
no  I will go in there .
oh yeah .
phoebe come here haha !
damn you monica geller hyphen bing !
hey , look who is here !
it is joey , and he brought home a friend .
joey , emma's right here !
you promised not to bring girls home in the middle of the day anymore .
no , no , it is not a girl , it is .
.
.
a brand new hugsy !
oh that is so great , now emma has two hugsy's .
no , no , emma has one hugsy , the new hugsy , huh ?
the other hugsy , i do not know , i guess I will just take it back .
oh you know what ?
when i was a little girl i had a little pink pony named cotton .
oh i loved her so much , i took her everywhere , i would braid her tail .
.
.
make the transfer !
should i be concerned that a button fell off the old hugsy and i can not find it ?
oh , no do not worry about that , i swallowed that years ago .
oh , i do not think she likes the new hugsy .
but he is the same .
yeah , i think she wants the old one back .
but he is the same .
joey , come on !
he is the same !
you are not the same !
haha !
you know , it is a lot less surprising to do that after I have buzzed you into the building .
so phoebe , why are there men's shoes by the door .
those are my shoes .
oh , when you get over this breakup we need to go shopping .
monica , i really appreciate you checking in on me , but I am actually feeling a lot better .
yeah , i just kind of want to be alone right now .
who is that ?
i ordered chinese food .
what are the chances ?
1 billion chinese people and they send mike !
?
what are you doing here ?
phoebe !
I am sorry , i broke down .
.
.
i wanted to see him .
damnit phoebe !
how did you even call him ?
there is a speakerphone on the base unit .
.
.
base unit !
think monica !
think !
this does not concern you !
!
look , guys , you can not do this , it is just going to make getting over each other , that much harder .
not if nothing happens .
why can not .
.
.
why can not we just hang out as friends ?
sure !
if you are just going to hang out as friends , then maybe I will join ya .
you know , I am your friend  and mike's friend  .
sit down .
oh wow wow wow !
!
make room for your friend !
I have been pretty good !
thanks , you look good too .
oh no no no no .
.
.
this is dangerous territory .
keep it clean !
so how is the piano playing going ?
I have missed you too .
you know , on the way over here , i saw this drunk guy throw up .
and then a pigeon ate it !
hey , ross , i just wanted to apologize .
.
.
do not tell me you actually made those gay pictures of me ?
uhu uhu , check this out .
huh !
so that is what i would look like if i worked out .
.
.
and was being serviced by a policeman .
you are not actually going to send these out are ya ?
eh  actually no , i do not need to because your little ross is dead  joke did not work , ok , there were no responses .
nobody posted anything on the website , nobody called my parents , so the joke my friend is on you .
nobody called , nobody wrote anything , nobody cares that I am dead .
oh my god !
nobody cares that I am dead !
?
no , come on , you know that is not true .
what are you talking about ?
you get sixty responses just for coming out of the closet !
i did not get one response !
and I am dead !
well , the gay community is a lot more vocal than the dead community .
i can not believe this .
not even my geology lab partner ?
and i carried that guy !
alright look , let us think about this , ok , do you really think that people are going to stir up your family at this tragic time ?
that people are going to post condolences on a website ?
this is not about people not caring that you are dead .this is about people not having a decent outlet for their grief .
you are right .
there is not a decent outlet .
right , i mean , come on , I am sure that if you had a funeral or a memorial service , tons of people would come .
exactly !
!
ross , what are you .
.
.
what are you .
.
.
what are you doing ?
you are having a memorial service for yourself !
?
no !
that would be stupid !
you are having it for me !
ross , do not press send , do not press se .
.
.
!
oh , too late , too late !
it is sent .
.
.
oops sorry and so is the picture of you and the police man .

no , now i know that emma wants him but he is mine and i need him .
.
oh god .
.
.
.
she is being unreasonable !
joey , there is a reason that emma loves that stupid penguin so much  oh do not cover its ears !
it is because it reminds her of her uncle joey !
it does ?
yeah !
and she is comforted by him because she loves her uncle joey so much .
really ?
she .
.
.
she loves me ?
oh yeah !
but you know what ?
if you need hugsy , do not worry .
emma will totally understand .
i will not .
.
.

chandler , chandler bing .
I am not gay , I am not gay at all .
you are married though .
do not listen to him , he is in a really bad mood !
i did not know ross and you were so close .
I am sure that would mean a lot to him .
and if heaven has a door , I am sure he is pressing his ear up against it and listening intently .
but you did not !
I am still alive !
!
kori , i know this is a big surprise for you .
it is a long story but the things you just said really made my day !
i mean , the fact that you are here means more to me than if this room were filled with people !
did you hear that ?
kori weston had a crush on me !
!
no mum , I am not dead .
i know it is not something to kid about .
it was just a practical joke between chandler and me , but it is over , ok ?

i mean , i just i can t , i can t believe this .
y know , i mean you think you know someone even , even phoebe who s always been somewhat of a question mark .
this is so bizarre .
i guess it kind of makes sense though , y know she had such a terrible childhood .

yes , but you are dead inside .
all right well , i d better take that back .
wh what , why ?
we can t watch that !

hey !
chicken soup for the soul ?
there s no back to this couch !
why are you reading this ?

maybe one of those stories would make me cry and then you wouldn t think i was y know , all dead inside .
oh that s so sweet !
look chandler i don t care if you can t cry , i love you .
oh that makes me feel so warm in my hollow tin chest .
stop it !
no , i mean , come on , seriously think about it , we get married , we re up at the altar and i m like this .
i won t care , because i know you will be feeling it all in here .
yeah ?
yeah !
and if , and if we have a baby one day , and the doctor hands it to you in the delivery room and you don t cry , so what !
and and and , and if we take him to college and come home and see his empty room for the first time , and you got nothing , it won t matter to me .
okay , well i won t uh , worry about this anymore then .
and and and if i die , from a long illness .
and you re writing out my eulogy and you open a desk drawer and you find a note from me that says , i will always be with you ,  and you still can t she would one tiny tear , i know you ll be crying a river inside .
aww , i love you so  what is wrong with you ?
!

of okay , rach calm calm down , okay ?
she she s really upset we re just talking .
ross !
i think she is trying to make something happen with you to get back at me !
so that s the only reason she could be here huh ?
it couldn t have anything to do with the fact that that maybe i m a good listener and i uh i put on a great slide show !
ross , i am telling you that she is using you to get back at me !
y know what ?
i think i can take care of myself , i ll talk to you later .
good bye .
whoa !
uh , that was your sister actually .
she she thinks that you re just using me .
hey !
hey !
so , i just came from the company ursula works for .
oh no , not you too !
no !
no !
i just went to pick up phoebe buffay s checks ; there were a lot of them .
nice !
um mmm , and i won t have to go there anymore because i gave them my correct address .
that s great , but isn t it going to bother that people still think you re a porn star ?
oh no !
no !
i know how to handle it .
you do ?
yeah .
you re trying to figure out where you know me from ?
all right , i ll give you a hint .
from porn !
okay ?
yeah your pervert boyfriend watched me in a porno movie !
see ?
yeah .
hey .
you uh , you may have been right about jill .
oh !
i knew it !
what happened ?
umm , she kissed me .
what ?
!
you kissed !
maybe we should give them some privacy .
shhhh !
!
!
look , i uh , i tried not to kiss her , okay ?
well , it doesn t sound like it !
i mean , it s pretty easy not to kiss someone , you just don t kiss them !
see look at us , right now , not kissing !
let me finish , okay ?
she started kissing me and and i didn t stop it .
i guess i i just wasn t thinking  yeah that s right you weren t thinking !
y know what ?
let me give you something to think about !
oh wait hold it !
but then i started thinking and i stopped the kissing .
oh , well thank you for taking your tongue out of my sister s mouth long enough to tell me that .
look i i realize if anything were to happen with me and jill then nothing could ever happen with us !
what ?
!
no , i mean , look i don t know if anything is going to happen with us , again .
ever .
but i don t want to know that it it never could .
so i stopped it and she got mad and broke my projector .
wow .
i , i don t even know what to say .
thank you .
you re welcome .
oh my god !
are are you crying ?
i just don t see why those two can t work things out !
yeah , i got that .

i can t help it , i opened a gate .
that s like the tenth time i ve peed since i ve been here !
that s also like the tenth time you told us .
yeah , oh i m sorry , it must be really hard to hear !
i tell ya , it s a lot easier having three babies play bringing in the noise , bringing in da funk on your bladder !
i m so sick of being pregnant !
the only happiness i get is from a cup of coffee , which of course is decaf ,  because oh !
i m pregnant !

oh , well , actually we were just talking about me not going to ross s wedding .
oh !
it just might be too hard , given the history and all that  wow !
this reminds me of the time when i was umm , living on the street and this guy offered to buy me food if i slept with him .
well , h how is this like that ?
well , let s see , it s not .
really , like that .
because , you see that was an actual problem , and uh , yours is just like y know a bunch of y know high school crap that nobody really gives y know   i m i m sorry , i just thought that  alrighty , here come the water works .
ugh !
i don t know what i m going to do !
i called the company that sent and th they don t care !
then i called 9 1 1 and they laughed at me , if this isn t an emergency , then what is ?
hey guys !
hey !
hey  i just wanted to thank you again for last night , what a great party !
and the guys from work had a blast .
y know , one of them had never been to a bachelor party before .
yeah !
and and another one had never been to a party before , so  so uh , hey , that uh , that wedding ring , huh ?
man , that s nice !
yeah , right !
i was uh , i was thinking i might want to pick one of those babies up for myself , i might want to get one of those  that ring ?
when my grandmother first came to this country , that ring and the clothes on her back were all she had with her .
so you might say , the ring is irreplaceable ?
oh absolutely !
it has been in my family for generations , and every bride who has worn it has had a long and happy life .
so you might say , it s a magic ring .
yeah , the stripper stole it .
my my ring ?
my my wedding ring ?
the the stripper stole my wedding ring ?
!
h how ?
!
how could this all happen ?
!
well , i think it all started when you said , hey joey , why don t you be my best man .
all right all right , fine !
i i m going to call the cops !
dude , i screwed up , you don t have to turn me in !
not on you !
on the stripper !
oh , yeah , well i already did that !
they said they re going to look into it right after they solved all the murders .
okay , well , we ll call the company that sent her !
i did that too !
they wouldn t give me her real name or her number .
they said , if i bothered them again they d call the police .
i said , if you talk to the police , you tell them i m missing a ring !
so what , joey ?
wh wh what ?
what are you telling me ?
that there s nothing we can do ?
well , how could this happen ?
!
look ross , i am so so sorry .
i i i  well , what if we just ah , called her , used a fake name , and had her come to my office ?
oh , that sounds like fun , but we ve got a ring to find !
!

i did not say that !
it is in a bank guarded by robots !
do you have any ideas ?

joe .
.
.
emus are birds .
you raise them for meat .
yeah !

bird meat .
.
.
now do they just fly into your mouth or you go to .
.
.
you go to a restaurant and you say : excuse me , I will have a bucket of fried bird .
or .
.
.
or maybe just a wing or .
.
.
joey , i think you should consider something a little less risky .
i mean , i think in this market , real estate is your best investment.the fed .
just lowered the rates and the interest on your mortgage is totally deductible .
that is right , i know some stuff !
real estate , huh ?
hmmm .
.
.
oh , and you know who is selling a great apartment ?
richard !
oh , and you know whose knowledge of her ex boyfriend is shocking ?
monica !
my dad told me .

i just hope the club does not slip out of my hand and beat the moustache off his face .
hi !
listen !
you have to help me pick a dress because I am meeting mike's parents tonight !
wow , the boyfriend's parents !
that is a big step .

they just going to love you , just be yourself .
they live on the upper east side on park avenue !
oh yeah , she can not be herself .
okay , so .
.
.
allright .
.
.

you can say neither  .
I am sorry honey , but we are going to take you shopping .
it is going to be fine .
yeah , totally !
you are in such good hands .
and I am so good with meeting parents .
with the father , you know , you want to flirt a little bit , but not in a gross way .
just kind of like : oh mr .
pincer , i can see where wallis gets his good looks .
.
.

uh , he took the sat's for me .
i knew you did not get a 1400 !
ssshyeah , well , duh !

.
.

you sang .
.
.
to our baby daughter .
.
.
a song about a guy who likes to have sex with women with giant asses ?
but you know what , if you think about it , it actually promotes a healthy uhm .
.
.
body image .
.
.
because .
.
.
even big butts or uhm .
.
.
juicy doubles .
owwwww .
.
.
please do not take her away from me !
hi I am joey .
this is chandler .
so how come richard's selling the place ?
went bankrupt ?
medical malpractice ?
choked on his own moustache ?
mmm that is enough about you !

no , no , no , no , no , no !
no , no .
.
.
we are not together .
we are not a couple .
we are definately not a couple .

originally I am from upstate , but uhm .
.
.
then my mom killed herself and my stepdad went to prison , so .
.
.
i just moved to the city where uhm .
.
.
i actually lived in a burned out buick lesabre for a while .
.
.
which was okay , that was okay , until uhm .
.
.
i got hepatitis , you know , because this pimp spit in my mouth and .
.
.
but i .
.
.
i got over it and uhm .
.
.
anyway , now I am uhm .
.
.
a freelance massage therapist , uhm .
.
.
which , you know , is not always steady money but at least i do not pay taxes , huh .
.
.

.
oh bitsy , hi .
uhm .
.
.
listen i just wanted to thank you again for having me here tonight .
also uhm .
.
.
i just want you to know what a wonderful man your son is .
well , and you know , it really is a testament to how he was raised .
especially to you .
because he is very respectful of women .
are you kidding .
he is so considerate of my feelings and .
.
.
you know i think .
.
.
you would also like to know that he is a very gentle lover .
oh no , no , no , no , no , no .
do not get me wrong .
no , he is not in like a sissy way .
no , no , no .
.
.
when he gets going , he can rattle a headboard like a sailor on leave .
.
.
I am not going to watch it .
.
.
i do not need to watch it .
.
.
i mean , what good could possibly come from watching ?
well , we know I am going to watch it .
hey dude , what is up ?
do not judge me , I am only human !
did you take that tape ?
i had to !
okay , imagine you were married .
.
.
and you found a tape of your wife in another guys ' apartment .
.
.
would not you need to know what was on it ?
i do not know .
who'm I am married to ?
some girl .
.
.
!
?
she hot ?
yeah .
.
.
!
?
how did she get me to settle down ?
allright , I am going to watch it .
.
.
i mean look , it is probably not even what i think it is .
.
.
and even if it is .
.
.
it can not possibly be as bad as what I am picturing in my head .
.
.
can it ?
guess i do not know .
my experience : if a girl says yes to being taped .
.
.
she does not say no to much else , i tell ya .
.
.
then you are going to have to watch it for me .
what ?
whoo .
.
.
what ?
just for a few seconds , so i can know what it is .
.
.
please ?
all right , fine .
.
.
but if i enjoy this , you have only yourself to blame .
.
.
why am i hearing cheering ?
well it is okay , its like .
.
.
its just a football game .
football ?
just football ?
yeah , see .
.
.
you were all worried for nothing .
it is football .
.
.
it is just football .
.
.

this is the first time I have ever enjoyed football .
.
.
it may be customary to get a beer .
.
.

.
.

you do not want to see what i just saw !
what are you guys doing ?

.
.
aahhh .
.
.
please laugh for mommy .
.
.
please ?
please laugh for mommy .
.
.
not funny huh ?
oh so , is it .
.
.
only offensive novelty rap ?
or maybe just , you know , rap in general ?
because mommy can rap .
.
.
my name is mommy and I am here to say  / that all the babies are .
.
.
oh , i can not rap .
.
.
allright sweetheart .
.
.
this is only because i love you so much , and i know that you are not going to tell anybody .
.
.
i like .
.
.
big butts and i cannot lie .
.
.
/ you other brothers can not deny .
.
.
/ when a girl walks in with an itty bitty waist and a round thing in your face .
.
.
yes !
yes !
yes !
yes !
oohhhhh !
oh !
i like big butts and i cannot lie .
.
.
/ you other brothers can not deny .
.
.
oh emma you are laughing !
oh you are , you really do like big butts , do not you .
oh you beautiful little weirdo .
.
.
hey !
oh you missed it .
she was laughing .
oh it was amazing .
it was amazing .
it was the most beautiful , beautiful sound that .
.
.
oh i know , is not it ?
ooh .
.
.
what did you do to get her to laugh ?
oh !
you know , i just .
.
.
couple of things i tried  .
.
.
i just sang a little doo .
.
.
itsy bitsy spider .
.
.
you sang baby got back did not you ?
nothing else worked .
that girl is all about the ass .
.
.
.
and then it goes back to the chorus .
.
.
smelly cat , sme lly ca t  / i t's not your fau lt .
and that is the end of the song .
.
.
i realise that you did not ask to hear it , but uhm .
.
.
no one had spoken in seventeen minutes .
oh , pervert parade ?
oh , ode to a pubic hair ?
oh god !
is that veal ?
oh no , no , no , no .
.
.
that is okay , that is okay .
.
.
i mean , I am .
.
.
i am a vegetarian .
.
.
except for veal .
.
.
yeah no , veal i love .
.
.
no , no , no , i actually it is any baby animals : kittens , fish babies .
.
.
you know .
.
.
especially veal .
.
.
and this , this nice vein of fat running through it .
.
.
hmmm .
.
.
yummy  hmmm .
.
.
so you stole that tape from richard's apartment ?
whoho ho .
.
.
listen to the judgement from the porn star !
that tape was never meant to be seen by .
.
.
joey i would feel more comfortable if i was having this conversation in private .
monica , look .
.
.
i do not think you and i have any secrets anymore .
.
.
not ready to joke about it yet , okay , i see you later .
why in the world would you take this tape and and why would you watch it ?
because that is who i am , okay ?
I am sure a mature man like richard could see a tape like that and it would not bother him .
just'd be another saucy anecdote for him to share at his men's club over brandy and moustaches .
is all this about you not being able to grow a moustache ?
this is about you and richard .
he is clearly not over you .
he keeps a tape so he can .
.
.
look at it whenever he wants .
is not that sad ?
i mean , can you see how pathetic that is ?
you should not be jealous .
you should feel bad for him .
oh , yeah , well , poor richard .
y ' .
.
.
i can grow a moustache !
chandler , this is not our problem .
we have got each other .
that is all that matters .
yeah , oh , but i just keep picturing you rolling around with him with your cowboy boots in the air .
.
.
cowboy boots ?
I have never worn cowboy boots in my whole life !
oh , good , good .
play more , because i want to see how it ends .
that is not me !
what .
.
.
?
that is not you !
life is good again !
ride  them cowgirl !
that bastard taped over me !
is that a problem ?
i it is just so insulting !
big spring for a new blank tape , doctor !
yeah .
.
.
the woman you what ?
i love you too .
.
.
yeah .
.
.
!
how great is this .
.
.
?
okay .
i had a great time .
it was really top drawer .
and here is something rich : thirteen bathrooms in this place .
.

and your friend phoebe ?
well , if she is my friend , hopefully she will understand .
i mean , would not you guys ?

rach you did not leave the water running .
please , just pull yourself together , okay ?
ah , did i leave the stove on ?

oh my god , you know what , yeah , i think you re right .
i think   listen , listen !
ubb .
a pigeon , a pigeon .
no , no wait , no no , an eagle flew in .
landed on the stove and caught fire .
the baby , seeing this , jumps across the apartment to the mighty bird s aid .
the eagle , however , misconstrues as an act of aggression and grabs the baby on its talon .
meanwhile the faucet fills the apartment with water .
baby and bird still up lays  are locked in a death grip , swirling around the whirl pool , that fills the apartment .
boy , are you going to be sorry if that s true .
maybe we should just eat now .
wha a how about this : another table leaves , right ?
but there s still some food left on their place , okay , what s the restaurant s policy about people eatin  that ?
but it happens ?
i m got to go to the bathroom .

i can t make love to you while we re fighting this way .
oh sure , now you re mister sensitivity .
but when you wanted to have sex right after my uncle s funeral that was a celebration of life .
alright , look , i m not going to do this .

no , you re right .
mnya , we shouldn t do it like this .

oh hey you guys !
oh hey !
hi !
hey listen let me ask you , do you believe in soul mates ?
oh yes i do .
i do .
i believe that there is one perfect person out there for everyone .
and do you know how you find him ?
you stop looking for him .
that s why i stopped looking for russell crowe .
he ll find me .
uh huh ,  and you ?
no .
i mean i believe that uh , certain people are more suited for each other and i believe in falling in love , but soul mates , i don t think they exist .
okay , good .
why ?
well last night , i met monica s .
what ?
yeah , i had a date with this guy , and i swear to god , he is her other half .
come on , don t be crazy .
you don t think there s someone out there better suited for monica than me , do ya ?
well , what s he like ?
!
well he s tall .
uh huh .
he has brown hair .
of course , of course .
a tall guy with hair similar to mine , oh unknowable universe !
he works with food !
oh sure .
older ?
obviously , and he s british .
oh , i was just going to ask !
yeah ?
and , he s he s so centered and mature and confident .
oh , it s so sad they never had a chance to meet .
luckily , the guy she settled for can t hear what you re talking about .
oh , i m so sorry .
um , and maybe i m wrong !
i but y know i m going to go out with him again , i ll find out more .
you believe that this guy is destined for someone else and you re still going to date him ?
well , he may not be my soul mate , but a girl s got to eat .
hey .
hey .
i just talked to joey , i just i want to see how you were .
oh y know , i still i can t believe it .
joey and rachel i mean it s  it s like you and me going out , only weirder !
all right , i know you re hurting , and and i want to be supportive , but don t say that again .
oh my god !
what if , what if they get married ?
then he d be the stepfather of my child .
honey , i don t think that s something we need to worry about !
first of all he s he s never going to tell her how he feels about her .
and even if he did you have no idea how she d react .
sure , because women never like joey .
y know , i think he s a virgin .
joey he s not even thinking about going after rachel !
he s not ?
no !
all he s thinking about is how you re taking this !
i mean , listen it s totally freaking him out .
he s talking about moving to vermont .
why ?
he says he wants to leave the country .
he thinks you hate him .
hate him ?
i  no , i don t hate him .
it s just it s rachel , y know ?
honey i can t even imagine how hard this must be for you .
but , i don t want you to lose joey over it .
and right now he just needs to know that you re still his friend .
okay .
okay , i ll talk to him .
all right .
now do it soon , he just asked me how to convert his dollars into vermont money .
oh !
hi !
hi !
umm , chandler , monica , this is don .
soul mate .
what ?
soul mate .
so , what have you guys been doing ?
i know !
what is this , 1985 ?
!
not really .
what s wrong with sun dried tomatoes ?
on a barbecue chicken pizza ?
no ?
so don , what what other restaurants do you like ?
oh my god !
that s my restaurant , i m the chef there .
no !
oh , i d like a latte .
oh y know what ?
if you re going to talk about me , i m going to go with you .
what are you doing ?
!
nothing !
i swear to god i didn t know you guys would be here !
and the good news is you didn t believe in soul mates .
so  i believe in tall , handsome strangers who hit on my wife !
they re just talking , and y know what ?
just because i think they re soul mates doesn t mean anything s going to happen .
phoebe , good work .
yeah ?
yeah !
oh he s great , i love him .
don t worry , we ll find you someone else .
hey .
hey .
look , i understand if you came by to hit me , i deserve it .
no , i don t want to hit you .
oh what then ?
kick me ?
no .
bite me ?
no , no i don t want to do anything to you .
all right ?
i just want to tell you that i m not mad at you and and that i certainly do not hate you .
i just , i just came here to say that .
oh now hey ross ross !
do you want to want to come in for a beer or something ?
uh yeah sure .
do uh , do you got any beer ?
all all i got is this melon stuff that rachel left .
i don t  okay .
hey look ross , you need to understand something okay ?
i uh i am never going to act on this rachel thing , okay ?
i i would never do anything to jeopardize my friendship with you .
thank you .
anyway , it uh look it ll just take me a while to get over her , that s all .
i m not even sure how to do that , i mean i ve never been in love before so  what ?
!
you re in love with her .
yeah , i thought you knew that .
umm , no .
wow .
hey look , if it helps , i don t want to feel this way .
honest .
i just keep thinking , ah , i ll get over this .
y know ?
i just it just keeps gettin  harder .
i don t , i don t know what to do .
y know ?
what do i do ?
i think you need to tell her how you feel .
okay that s the green stuff talkin  .
no , i m serious .
you you need to find out where she is , because if she s not where you are , then you can start to move past this .
but what if uh and i m not saying she will be but  if she is where you are then uh then my feeling weird about it shouldn t stand in the way .
are you sure ?
yeah .
look if if she s going to end up with somebody else , the truth is she couldn t find a better guy .
so  hey thanks .
so when do you think you re going to talk to her ?
oh my god i have to tell her !
i haven t even thought about what i will say .
what should i say ?
i m understanding , but let s not get carried away .
i m sorry , you re right .
what am i going to say ?
oh !
yeah , tell me about it .
cheese you say ?
that s some pretty smelly work , huh don ?
cheese , it s smelly .
you must smell a lot of the time too .
me too !
yeah , chandler can t stand it .
he won t even allow me to have blue cheese in the house .
you know what i d love to do ?
i would like to go to france and eat nothing but bread and cheese not even bread , just cheese .
no , i want the bread .
yeah .
ah , and pastries   and pate .
oh , i m really not high , it s just i used to be fat .
is it made of cheese ?
i d move in tomorrow !
oh come on !
are you listening to this ?
i m so sorry .
what do we do ?
i don t know , they both want to live in a house of cheese !
i don t know how you fight that .
okay .
okay , i can do this .
i can tell her how i feel .
just uh , just stand up straight .
take a couple deep breaths .
look confident .

chandler , you don t believe in soul mates ?
no .
but i m sure   tomatoes  does .
i don t believe in soul mates either .

no .
i don t think that you and i were destined to end up together .
i think that we fell in love and work hard at our relationship .
some days we work really hard .
so you you don t want to live with don in a cheese house ?
no , i ve had second thoughts about that .
do you realize how hard that would be to clean ?

that s my favorite shirt !
okay ?
i love that shirt !
well just ask mona to give it back !
i don t know .
i mean i i guess i could .
it s just that we didn t really end things such good terms .
and if i go over there i d be ignoring the one thing she asked me to do when we broke up , jump up my own ass and die .
oh wait a second you guys for the last couple weeks i ve been that guy everywhere i go .
we take the same bus .
we go to the same bookstore , the same dry cleaners ; maybe he s the tea guy .
phoebe , did you see that ?
!
he totally checked you out !
he is so cute !
mine has a picture of the village people , what does that mean ?
hi !
hey .
hi .
hi .
tea gives phoebe the trots .
so i thought joey and i would be okay once we hung out , but it s not even like we know how to be with each other anymore .
i know it s tough now , but things will get better .
how do you know that ?
what if it just gets worse and worse and worse , to the point where we can t even be in the same room with each other ?
!
i m not great at the advice , can i interest you in a sarcastic comment ?
some cheese ?
honey , what is the bruce springsteen cd in the kat stevens case ?

honey , i m going to save you some time , 200 cds , not one of them in the right case .
okay .
no need to panic .
deep breathes everyone .
okay umm uh , we re just going to have to spend some time and put the cds in the right cases .
well , if we re going to do that we should come up with some kind of order .

we really have to talk this through .
oh my god !
!
you guys have such problems !
!
i feel so terrible for you !
okay , i i m sorry .
you and joey , your both focusing on this uncomfortable thing , what you need to do is to change the subject .
next time you see him try to get him talking about something else .

that makes sense .
yeah , like i don t know , maybe you have a work problem that you need his advice on .
ooh , i can do that .

how about receiving ?
yes !
see joe , not that that s not grrreat !
but , one of the cool things about having somebody we know perform the ceremony is that it can be about us !
y know , it can be more personal .
you can tell stories about us !

i know .
you re a really good kisser .
well , i have kissed over four women .
do you want to get under the covers ?

because that other thing ?
i thought you were on to something , but it did nothing for me .
okay , can we change the topic ?
because it s really doing nothing for me .
oh   can you imagine if i hadn t left you that last one ?
you two might ve never gotten together .
ooh ooh !
could you imagine if i sent that hooker up to the room like i was going to ?
!
it s like it was in the stars !

!
who did you originally want to hook up with ?
okay , fine but please don t be upset !
okay ?
i was really depressed okay ?
and really drunk !
i just wanted something stupid and meaningless .
i just wanted just sex .
so , when i went to your room that night i was actually looking for joey .
yeah baby !
no baby !
so you came to the room looking for joey ?
did you ever in intend on telling me about this ?
no because it it didn t seem important .
oh , it s not important ?
it s not important ?

if it wasn t for a bride s maid you d be marrying him  not me !
noo !
!
the point is that is was you that was there that night !
it is you that i am marrying !
it is you that i feel in love with !
and it is a love that is based on having and giving and receiv  i don t believe it .
the most romantic night of my life and i m runner up .
chandler , please !
do you know how unbelievably glad i am that joey was not there that night ?
!
hey !
now i m a man of the cloth , but i still have feelings !
look there is no way you re doing this wedding now .
okay ?
what ?
!
that s not fair !
it s not my fault !
i was off with my bride s maid !
and who s to say i would ve even said yes ?
!
i mean i would ve said yes .
chandler look y y you are making way to big a deal out of this , all right ?
look , everything worked out okay !
okay , it s just weird !
okay ?
i don t want to be standing their saying my vows and then having the mental image of you and monica !
i i i need i don t know what i need .
i need a walk .
wait chandler come on , let s it s not a big deal !
it is to me .

this is crazy .
i know !
robin is so gay !
so now what have we agreed ?
and and what else ?
very good .
rachel !
what are you doing here ?
i m just visiting my good friend carol .
your good friend ?

the line that prompted a student in my last class of the day to say uh ,  dude , don t you ever was your face ?
all right , i m sorry .
i m sorry i didn t tell you but you were so mad already !
of course i was mad !
i told you i i hate this stuff !
okay ?

practical jokes .
you have a line down your face .
okay , maybe they are not funny to you  or carol !
but they re funny to kids and who is it hurting ?
!
uh , y know what ?
i ll tell you who it hurts !
it hurts the kid who has all his clothes stolen in gym class so he has to go to the principal s office wearing nothing but a catcher s mitt !
that was you ?
!
we heard about you in junior high !
did you really just shake your fist in the air and shout , i will be revenged ?
!
i will be !
listen , i don t want you teaching my son that stuff anymore .
okay ?
fine .
fine , but i ll have you know that once i taught him that stuff he called me fun aunt rachel .
and i loved being fun aunt rachel but i ll go back to being boring and uncomfortable aunt rachel if that s what you want !
no that s not what i want .
uh , i m glad you guys were bonding but i  look he doesn t have any brothers or sisters , somebody s going to have to teach him this stuff !
and i haven t taught him anything that a normal 6 year old doesn t know anyway !
i got to go !
hey .
hey .
do you want this scone ?
it came for me but it would probably rather sleep with you !
chandler , come on nothing even happened !
look joe , i know you wanted to do the wedding  no hey no !
if you don t want me to do it , i except that .
i don t care about that .
i just i don t want you to be upset .
how can i not be upset ?
okay ?
i finally fall in love with this fantastic woman and it turns out that she wanted you first !
yeah for like a half an hour one night !
chandler , she wants you for the rest of her life !
you re so lucky !
look what i missed out on by not being there !
although you know what ?
it could never have worked like you guys did ,  because you guys are perfect for each other .
y know , we look at you and and we see you together and it just it it fits .
y know ?
and you just know it s going to last forever .
that s what you should say .
what ?
when you re marrying us ; that s what you should say .
really ?
i can do it ?
i d love it if you would do it .
hey !
but those are the words !
those exact words !

i thought i was making him filet mignon ?
yeah , you were , but you decided to make salmon because you had some left over at the restaurant .
and then you realised if you  bitched about it , then you  would stop cooking , and you  would have to make your famous baked potato and diet coke .
wow , i really get crabby when i cook .
hey !

there s never going to be a president joey .
all right look man , i didn t want to bring this up , but chandler , is the stupidest name i ever heard in my life !

y know , the kind of fun , you and susan had when we were married .
am i ?

uh huh , carol , so were we .
all right , just just imagine for a moment , susan meets someone and and they really hit it off .

see , see , okay , i work in fashion , see and and , this is a real dress actually .
it s it s , they re they re wearing it in milan , so part of my job is too wear the clothes , and then i see how people respond , and then i report back to my superiors at bloomingdale s , so  and obviously in uh , in in this case ,  i am going to report back , usa not ready .

from now on , i have no first name .
so , you re just bing ?
i have no name .
all right , so , what are we supposed to call you ?
okay uh , for now , temporarily , you can call me , clint .
no way are you cool enough to pull of clint .
okay , so what name am i cool enough to pull off ?
umm , gene .
it s clint .
it s clint !
see you later , gene .
bye , gene .
it s clint !
clint !
what s up with gene ?

and uh , the best part though , when the uh , waiter spilled water down my back , i jumped up , and my boob popped out .
oh my god !
oh , no !
no , it s all right .
i got nice boobs .
so , i just picked up a message from emily , she and susan are going to a poetry reading together !
so ?
so !
poetry ?
susan s gay !
they re being gay together !
emily s straight .
oh , wake up !
wow , carol really messed you up !
excuse me ?
yeah , she turned you into this this this untrusting , crazy , jealous , sycophant .
all right , so i don t know what sycophant means , but the rest is right .
look , i don t know what you re talking about , i am not a crazy , jealous person .
huh .
what ?
she s totally right !
when we were together , you got all freaked out about mark and there was nothing going on .
this totally makes sense !
it does not !
oh , sure it does !
in high school , you weren t jealous at all even though all your girlfriends were cheating on you !
all right , all right , so up until  92 93 he was very trusting , then  94 hit , carol left him and bamn !
paranoid city !
absolutely !
absolutely !
this is so much fun !
this is not fun !
look , all we re trying to say is , don t let what happened with carol ruin what you got with emily .
yeah .
the  92 ross wouldn t .
well , i still think i was right about that whole mark thing .
what yeah what , y know what ?
i hope emily is a lesbian .
drum roll .
okay .
okay .
all right .
help !
am i a mark , or a john ?
nah , you re not tall enough to be a mark , but you might make a good barney .
all right look , am i serious , okay ?
tomorrow at 3:30 i am going down to the courthouse .
you re actually going through with this ?
hey , look , this name has been holding me back my entire life .
okay , it s probably why kids picked on me in school , and why i never do well with women  so , as of 4 of clock tomorrow , i m either going to be mark johnson or john markson .
you got problems because of you !
not your name !
all right , this has got to stop !
chandler is a great name !
in fact yes ,  i m , i m sorry .
i know you really wanted me to name the baby joey , but eh , so , i m i m , i m going to , i m going to name the baby chandler .
really ?
!
yeah , but you have to keep the name too !
okay .
thanks .
okay !
you want to hug it out ?
yeah !
yay !
yay !
yay oh yay !
okay , i got to go tell frank and alice !
right now !
okay !
ooh , uh   bye , pheebs !
okay , bye !
ha !
ha !
ha !
ohh !
nice luggage .
hi !
oh , i missed you too .
no tongue .
hi guys !
hey .
oh , oh , how did it go ?
um , not so good .
he walked me to the subway and said 'we should do this again ! '
what ?
he said 'we should do it again ' , that is good , right ?
uh , no .
loosely translated 'we should do this again ' means 'you will never see me naked ' .
since when ?
since always .
it is like dating language .
y'know , like 'it is not you ' means 'it is you ' .
or 'you are such a nice guy ' means 'I am going to be dating leather wearing alcoholics and complaining about them to you ' .
or , or , y'know , um , 'i think we should see other people ' means 'ha , ha , i already am ' .
and everybody knows this ?
yeah .
cushions the blow .
yeah , it is like when you are a kid , and your parents put your dog to sleep , and they tell you it went off to live on some farm .
that is funny , that , no , because , uh , our parents actually did , uh , send our dog off to live on a farm .
uh , ross .
what ?
wh   hello ?
the millners ' farm in connecticut ?
the millners , they had this unbelievable farm , they had horses , and , and rabbits that he could chase and it was   it w    .
.
.
oh my god , chi chi !
so how does it feel knowing you are about to die ?
warden , in five minutes my pain will be over .
but you will have to live with the knowledge that you sent an honest man to die .
hey , that was really good !
thanks !
let us keep going .
okay .
so .
whaddya want from me , damone , huh ?
i just want to go back to my cell .
because in my cell , i can smoke .
smoke away .
i think this is probably why damone smokes in his cell alone .
what ?
relax your hand !
not so much !
whoah !
hey !
hey !
alright , now try taking a puff .
alright .
.
okay .
no .
give it to me .
no no no , i am not giving you a cigarette .
it is fine , it is fine .
look , do you want to get this part , or not ?
here .
do not think of it as a cigarette .
think of it as the thing that is been missing from your hand .
when you are holding it , you feel right .
you feel complete .
y'miss it ?
nah , not so much .
alright , now we smoke .
oh .
.
my .
.
god .
no , no , no .
they say it is the same as the distance from the tip of a guy's thumb to the tip of his index finger .
that is ridiculous !
can i use .
.
either thumb ?
alright , do not tell me , do not tell me !
decaf cappucino for joey .
.
coffee black .

I am going through my mail , and i open up their monthly , you know , statement   easy .
and there is five hundred extra dollars in my account .
oh , satan's minions at work again .
.
.
yes , because now i have to go down there , and deal with them .
what are you talking about ?
keep it !
it is not mine , i did not earn it , if i kept it , it would be like stealing .
yeah , but if you spent it , it would be like shopping !
okay .
okay , let us say i bought a really great pair of shoes .
do you know what I would hear , with every step i took ?
'not mine .
not mine .
not mine . '
and even if i was happy , okay , and , and skipping   'not not mine , not not mine , not not mine , not not mine ' .
.
.
we are with you .
we got it .
okay .
I would   just   I would never be able to enjoy it .
it would be like this giant karmic debt .
chandler , what are you doing ?
hey .
whaddya doing ?
what is this ?
!
I am smoking .
I am smoking , I am smoking .
oh , i can not believe you !
you have been so good , for three years !
and this   is my reward !

what are you talking about ?
we love schhteve !
schhteve was schhexy !
.
.
sorry .
look , i do not even know how i feel about him yet .
just give me a chance to figure that out .
well , then can we meet him ?
nope .
schhorry .
i mean , why should i let them meet him ?
i mean , i bring a guy home , and within five minutes they are all over him .
i mean , they are like   coyotes , picking off the weak members of the herd .
i know .
i just wish that once , I would bring a guy home that they actually liked .
let it go , ross .
yeah , well , you did not know chi chi .
do you all promise ?
chandler ?
do you promise to be good ?
you can come in , but your filter tipped little buddy has to stay outside !
hey , pheebs .
'dear ms .
buffay .
thank you for calling attention to our error .
we have credited your account with five hundred dollars .
we are sorry for the inconvenience , and hope you will accept this     football phone as our free gift . '
do you believe this ?
!
now i have a thousand dollars , and a football phone !
what bank is this ?
hey .
it is him .
who is it ?
chandler !
he is here !
okay , please be good , please .
just remember how much you all like me .
hi .
alan , this is everybody .
everybody , this is alan .
thanks .
I will call you tomorrow .
okay .
okay , let us let the alan bashing begin .
who is going to take the first shot , hmm ?
c'mon !
.
I will go .
let us start with the way he kept picking at   no , I am sorry , i can not do this , can not do this .
we loved him .
wait a minute !
we are talking about someone that I am going out with ?
and did you notice .
.
.
?
know what was great ?
the way his smile was kind of crooked .
yes , yes !
like the man in the shoe !
.
what shoe ?
from the nursery rhyme .
'there was a crooked man , who had a crooked smile , who lived in a shoe , for a .
.
.
while .
.
. '
.
so i think alan will become the yardstick against which all future boyfriends will be measured .
what future boyfriends ?
nono , i th   i think this could be , y'know , it .
really !
oh , yeah .
I would marry him just for his david hasselhof impression alone .
you know I am going to be doing that at parties , right ?
you know what i like most about him , though ?
the way he makes me feel about myself .
hi .
.
how was the game ?
well .
.
fantastic !
i have one question : how is that possible ?
alan .
he was unbelievable .
he was like that that that bugs bunny cartoon where bugs is playing all the positions , right , but instead of bugs it was first base alan , second base alan , third base   .
.
.
i mean , it it was like , it was like he made us into a team .
yep , we sure showed those hassidic jewellers a thing or two about softball .
.
can i ask you guys a question ?
d'you ever think that alan is maybe .
.
sometimes .
.
what ?
i dunno , a little too alan ?
well , no .
that is impossible .
you can never be too alan .
yeah , it is his , uh , innate alan ness that that that we adore .
i personally could have a gallon of alan .
hey , lizzie .
i brought you alphabet soup .
yes .
but i left in the ys .
because , y'know , sometimes y  .
uh , i also have something else for you .
no , but would you like a thousand dollars and a football phone ?
i know .
no , i want you to have it .
i do not want it .
oh , that is fine , no .
no .
because you need that .
no , it is okay , thanks .
okay , alright , you buy me a soda , and then we are even .
okay ?
okay .
no , I am fine .
huh !
a thumb ?
!
i know !
i know , i opened it up and there it was , just floating in there , like this tiny little hitch hiker !
well , maybe it is a contest , y'know ?
like , collect all five ?
does , um , anyone want to see ?
it is worse than the thumb !
hey , this is so unfair !
oh , why is it unfair ?
so i have a flaw !
big deal !
like joey's constant knuckle cracking is not annoying ?
and ross , with his over pronouncing every single word ?
and monica , with that snort when she laughs ?
i mean , what the hell is that thing ?
.
i accept all those flaws , why can not you accept me for this ?
.
does the knuckle cracking bother everybody ?
well , i i could live without it .
well , is it , like , a little annoying , or is it like when phoebe chews her hair ?
oh , now , do not listen to him , pheebs , i think it is endearing .
oh ,  you do , do you  ?
you know , there is nothing wrong with speaking correctly .
indeed there is not  .
.
.
i should really get back to work .
yeah , because otherwise someone might get what they actually ordered .
ohh ho hooohhh .
the hair comes out , and the gloves come on .
did you ever go out with a guy your friends all really like ?
okay .
.
well , I am going out with a guy my friends all really like .
can you believe it ?
.
y'know what ?
i just do not feel the thing .
i mean , they feel the thing , i do not feel the thing .
i know .
.
it is going to be really hard .
no , he will be fine .
it is the other five I am worried about .
do you have any respect for your body ?
do not you realise what you are you are doing to yourself ?
hey , y'know , i have had it with you guys and your cancer and your emphysema and your heart disease .
the bottom line is , smoking is cool , and you know it .
chandler ?
it is alan , he wants to speak to you .
really ?
he does ?
hey , buddy , what is up !
oh , she told you about that , huh .
well , yeah , i have one now and then .
well , yeah , now .
well , it is not that big     well , that is true , .
.
gee , y'know , no one   no one's ever put it like that before .
well , okay , thanks !
god , he is good .
if only he were a woman .
yeah .
ooh , lambchop .
how old is that sock ?
if i had a sock on my hand for thirty years it would be talking too .
okay .
i think it is time to change somebody is nicotine patch .
hey .
where is joey ?
joey ate my last stick of gum , so i killed him .
do you think that was wrong ?
i think he is across the hall .
thanks .
there y'go .
ooh , I am alive with pleasure now .
hey pheebs , you going to have the rest of that pop tart ?
.
.
pheebs ?
does anyone want the rest of this pop tart ?
hey , i might !
sorry .
y'know , those stupid soda people gave me seven thousand dollars for the thumb .
and on my way over here , i stepped in gum .
.
what is up with the universe ?
!
what is going on ?
nothing .
i just think it is nice when we are all here together .
even nicer when everyone gets to wear their underwear .
.
uh , joey .
.
oh , god !
okay .
.
please , guys , we have to talk .
wait , wait , I am getting a deja vu .
no , I am not .
alright , we have to talk .
there it is !
okay .
it is it is about alan .
there is something that you should know .
i mean , there is really no easy way to say this .
.
uh .
.
I have decided to break up with alan .
is there somebody else ?
no , nononono .
.
it is just .
.
things change .
people change .
we did not change .
.
so that is it ?
it is over ?
just like that ?
you know .
.
you let your guard down , you start to really care about someone , and i just   i    look , i   i could go on pretending   okay !
but that would not be fair to me , it would not be fair to alan   it would not be fair to you !
who who wants fair ?
y'know , i just want things back .
y'know , the way they were .
I am sorry .
.
oh , she is sorry !
i feel better !
i just can not believe this !
i mean , with the holidays coming up   i wanted him to meet my family   I will meet somone else .
there will be other alans .
are you guys going to be okay ?
hey hey , we will be fine .
we are just going to need a little time .
i understand .
I am , I am really sorry .
relieved ?
remember when we went to central park and rented boats ?
.
.
that was fun .
yeah .
he could row like a viking .

yeah , alright .
terry , i , i , i know that i have not worked here very long , but i was wondering , do you think it would be possible if i got a $100 advance in my salary ?
it is so that i can spend thanksgiving with my family .
see , every year we go skiing in vail , and normally my father pays for my ticket , but i sort of started the whole independence thing , you know , which is actually why i took this job .
ok , i , i hear what you are sayin ' .
I am with you .
um , but i , but I am trying really hard .
and i think I am doing better .
i really do .
does anybody need coffee ?
oh , look at that .
excuse me , sir .
hi , you come in here all time .
i was just wondering , do you think there is a possibility that you could give me an advance on my tips ?
ok , ok , that is fine .
fine .
hey , I am sorry about that spill before .
only $98.50 to go .
hey .
ross , did you know mom and dad are going to puerto rico for thanksgiving ?

hey , hey .
hey .
hey .
and this from the cry for help department .
are you wearing makeup ?
yes , i am .
as of today , i am officially joey tribbiani , actor slash model .
that is so funny , because i was thinking you look more like joey tribbiani , man slash woman .
what were you modeling for ?
you know those posters for the city free clinic ?
oh , wow , so you are going to be one of those healthy , healthy , healthy guys  ?
you know , the asthma guy was really cute .
do you know which one you are going to be ?
no , but i hear lyme disease is open , so .
.
.
good luck , man .
i hope you get it .
thanks .
well , you were right .
how can they do this to us , huh ?
it is thanksgiving .
ok , I will tell you what .
how about i cook dinner at my place ?
I will make it just like mom's .
will you make the mashed potatoes with the lumps ?
you know , they are not actually supposed to have .
.
.
I will work on the lumps .
joey , you are going home , right ?
yeah .
and i assume , chandler , you are still boycotting all the pilgrim holidays .
yes , every single one of them .
phoebe , you are going to be with your grandma ?
yes , and her boyfriend .
but we are celebrating thanksgiving in december because he is lunar .
so you are free thursday , then .
yeah .
oh , can i come ?
yeah .
rach , are you thinking you are going to make it to vail ?
absolutely .
shoop , shoop , shoop .
only a hundred and two dollars to go .
i thought it was $98.50 .
yeah , well it was .
i , i broke a cup .
well , I am off to carol's .
ooh , ooh !
why do not we invite her ?
ooh , ooh .
because she is my ex wife , and will probably want to bring her , ooh , ooh , lesbian life partner .
hi , is uh , is carol here ?
oh , i uh , just came by to pick up my skull .
well , not mine , but .
susan : come in .
thanks .
yeah , carol borrowed it for a class , and i have to get it back to the museum .
kind of like a big face without skin .
ok .
wow , you guys sure have a lot of books about bein ' a lesbian .
hey , hey , yertle the turtle .
a classic .
the uh , the baby that has not been born yet ?
would not that mean you are .
.
.
crazy ?
you are not serious , i mean , you really .
.
.
you really talk to it ?
do you uh , do you talk about me ?
really ?
look , if she is talking to it , i just think that i should get some belly time too .
not that i believe any of this .
oh , i believe it .
i think the baby can totally hear everything .
i can show you .
look , this will seem a little weird , but you put your head inside this turkey , and then we will all talk , and you will hear everything we say .
I would just like to say that I am totally behind this experiment .
in fact , I would very much like to butter your head .
hey , rach , did you make your money ?
no , not even close .
forget vail , forget seeing my family , forget shoop , shoop , shoop .
rach , here is your mail .
thanks , you can just put it on the table .
no , here is your mail .
thanks , you can just put it on the table .
would you just open it ?
oh my god , oh , you guys are great .
we all chipped in .
we did ?
you owe me 20 bucks .
thank you .
thank you so much !
chandler , here you go , got your traditional thanksgiving feast , you got your tomato soup , your grilled cheese fixin's , and your family size bag of funyuns .
wait , wait , chandler , this is what you are havin ' for thanksgiving dinner ?
what , what , what is it with you and this holiday ?
all right , I am nine years old .
oh , i hate this story .
we just finished this magnificent thanksgiving dinner .
i have   and i remember this part vividly   a mouthful of pumpkin pie , and this is the moment my parents choose to tell me they are getting divorced .
oh my god .
yes .
it is very difficult to appreciate a thanksgiving dinner once you have seen it in reverse .
uh , hi .
we uh , we used to work together .
yeah , at macy's .
you were the obsession girl , right ?
i was the aramis guy .
aramis ?
aramis ?
i got to tell you .
you are the best in the business .
I am serious .
you are amazing .
you know when to spritz , when to lay back .
ooh , you smell great tonight .
what are you wearing ?
listen , uh , you want to go get a drink or something ?
what is wrong ?
oh .
what ?
wait , wait , wait !
so i guess you all saw it .
saw what ?
no , we were just laughing .
you know , how laughter can be infectious .
set another place for thanksgiving .
my entire family thinks i have vd .
tonight , on a very special blossom .
mmm , looking good .
ok , cider's mulling , turkey's turking , yams are yamming .
what ?
i do not know .
it is just not the same without mom in the kitchen .
all right , that is it .
you know what ?
just get out of my way and stop moping .
that is closer .
i got the tickets !
i got the tickets !
five hours from now , shoop , shoop , shoop .
oh , you must stop shooping .
ok , I am going to get my stuff .
chandler , will you just come in already ?
no , i prefer to keep a safe distance from all this merriment .
look out , incoming pumpkin pie !
ok , we all laughed when you did it with the stuffing , but that is not funny anymore .
hey , monica , i got a question .
i do not see any tater tots .
that is not a question .
but my mom always makes them .
it is like a tradition .
you get a little piece of turkey on your fork , a little cranberry sauce , and a tot !
it is bad enough i can not be with my family because of my disease .
all right , fine .
tonight's potatoes will be both mashed with lumps , and in the form of tots .
ok , I am off to talk to my unborn child .
ah !
ok , mom never hit .
ok , all done .
what , phoebe , did you whip the potatoes ?
ross needs lumps !
oh , I am sorry , oh , i just , i thought we could have them whipped and then add some peas and onions .
why would we do that ?
well , because then they would be like my mom used to make them , you know , before she died .
ok , three kinds of potatoes coming up .
ok , good bye you guys .
thanks for everything .
oh , sorry !
oh , sorry !
the most unbelievable thing has happened .
underdog has just gotten away .
the balloon ?
no , no , the actual cartoon character .
of course the balloon .
it is all over the news .
right before he reached macy's , he broke free and was spotted flying over washington square park .
I am goin ' to the roof , who is with me ?
i can not , i got to go .
come on .
an 80 foot inflatable dog let loose over the city .
how often does that happen ?
almost never .
got the keys ?
or got the keys !
ok .
ok , ok , here we go .
ok , where am i talking to , here ?
i mean , uh , well , there is one way that seems to offer a certain acoustical advantage , but .
.
.
ok , ok , ok , ok , here goes .
you know , i , you know , can not do this .
uh , this is too weird .
i feel stupid .
hello , baby .
hello , hello .
i loved the moment when you first saw the giant dog shadow all over the park .
yeah , but did they have to shoot him down ?
i mean , that was just mean .
ok , right about now the turkey should be crispy on the outside , juicy on the inside .
why are we standing here ?
we are waiting for you to open the door .
you got the keys .
no i do not .
yes , you do .
when we left , you said , got the keys .
no i did not .
i asked , got the ke eys ?
no , no , no , you said , got the keys  .
do either of you have the keys ?
the oven is on .
oh , i got to get my ticket !
wait , wait , we have a copy of your key .
well then get it , get it !
that tone will not make me go any faster .
joey !
that one will .
and everyone is telling me , you got to pick a major , you got to pick a major .
so , on a dare , i picked paleontology .
and you have no idea what I am saying , because , let us face it , you are a fetus .
you are just happy you do not have gills anymore .
oh , please .
i am not singing to your stomach , ok ?
shh !
here we come , walkin ' down the street , get the funniest looks from , everyone we meet .
hey , hey !
hey , uh , did you just feel that ?
does it always , uh     ?
hey , hey , you are my baby , and i can not wait to meet you .
when you come out I will buy you a bagel , and then we will go to the zoo .
hey , hey , I am your daddy .
I am the one without any breasts .
nope , not that one .
can you go any faster with that ?
hey , i got one keyhole and about a zillion keys .
you do the math .
why do you guys have so many keys in there anyway ?
for an emergency just like this .
all right , listen , smirky .
if it was not for you and your stupid balloon , i would be on a plane watching a woman do this  right now .
but I am not .
i swear you said you had the keys .
no , i did not .
i would not say i had the keys unless i had the keys , and i obviously did not have the keys .
ooh , ok , that is it .
enough with the keys .
no one say keys .
why would i have the keys ?
aside from the fact that you said you had them ?
but i did not .
well , you should have .
why ?
because !
why ?
because !
why ?
because everything is my responsibility ?
is not it enough that I am making thanksgiving dinner for everyone ?
you know , everyone wants a different kind of potatoes , so I am making different kinds of potatoes .
does anybody care what kind of potatoes i want ?
nooooo , no , no !
just as long as phoebe gets her peas and onions , and mario gets his tots , and it is my first thanksgiving , and it is all burned , and , and i .
.
.
i .
.
.
ok , monica , only dogs can hear you now , so , look , the door's open .
here we go .
well , the turkey's burnt .
potatoes are ruined , potatoes are ruined , potatoes are ruined .
here we come , walkin ' down the this does not smell like mom's .
no , it does not , does it ?
but you wanted lumps , ross ?
well , here you go , buddy , ya got one .
oh , god , this is great !
the plane is gone , so it looks like I am stuck here with you guys .
hey , we all had better plans .
this was nobody's first choice .
oh , really ?
so why was i busting my ass to make this delicious thanksgiving dinner ?
you call that delicious ?
stop it , stop it , stop it !
now this feels like thanksgiving .
ooh .
what ?
ugly naked guy's taking his turkey out of the oven .
oh my god .
he is not alone .
ugly naked guy's having thanksgiving dinner with ugly naked gal .
I have got to see this .
all right ugly naked guy !
ooh , ugly naked dancing !
it is nice that he has someone .
shall i carve ?
by all means .
ok , who wants light cheese , and who wants dark cheese ?
i do not even want to know about the dark cheese .
does anybody want to split this with me ?
oh , i will .
ooh , you guys have to make a wish .
make a wish ?
come on , you know , thanksgiving .
ooh , you got the bigger half .
what did you wish for ?
the bigger half .
I would like to propose a toast .
little toast here , ding ding .
i know this is not the kind of thanksgiving that all of you all planned , but for me , this has been really great , you know , i think because it did not involve divorce or projectile vomiting .
anyway , i was just thinking , i mean , if you would gone to vail , and if you guys'd been with your family , if you did not have syphilis and stuff , we would not be all together , you know ?
so i guess what I am trying to say is that I am very thankful that all of your thanksgivings sucked .
and hey , here is to a lousy christmas .
and a crappy new year .
here , here !
okay , chandler !
okay .
and your horoscope says , on the fifth a special someone is going to give you a gift .

i ll show you right how to do it .
i mean if you think about it , i mean ross did learn something from each marriage .
now wait a minute that s not fair .
he was married to me a hell of a lot longer than he was married to emily , he just didn t tell me .
maybe i have to pee again .
y know what ?
i i i  i i have had enough of this !
y know , i i i care a great deal about your daughter and i have treated her with nothing but respect !
so if if you ve got a problem with me , frankly  god no !
well if it doesn t matter to her , it doesn t matter to me !
still not yelling !
that s okay , i m not so crazy about myself right now either .
uh yeah , i guess yeah !

but surprise !
i missed most of the party  charlie's a girl , right ?

i do not know why joey had to kiss her !
i mean , of all the girls at the party , god !
why do you care so much ?

be because ross is the father of my child !
you know .
.
.
and i .
.
.
want him to hook up with lots of women !
i just .
.
.
all I am saying is .
.
.
i do not think that joey and charlie have anything in common .
oh , i do not know , they seem to have a shared interest in each other's tonsils .
.
.
wow , joey and a professor !
can you imagine if they had kids and if the kids got her intelligence and joey's raw sexual magnetism .
.
.
oh , those nerds will get laaaaaid !

her mind is totally acrimonious  .
that is not how she used it .
.
.
?
uhm no !
think less of you !
no , i do not think less of you .
i mean , you saw someone you liked and you kissed them .
i mean , those people who like someone and do not kiss them .
.
.
those those people are stupid , i hate those people .
yeah , i know the type .
hey , if you want to grab a bite before work we would better get acrimonious .
no ?
am i getting close ?
hey !
hey !
hey you guys !
look what i just got .
oh , oh !
wow , i love those !
where did you get them ?
i bought them off ebay !
they used to belong to the late shania twain .
phoebe , shania twain is still alive !
oh .
.
.
then i overpaid .
hey , what is this ?
oh , it is a gift certificate to this new spa in soho .
oh , you can not show phoebe this !
she hates those corporate massage chains .
ah , why , now i can not get a massage ?
there are so many things that she disapproves of !
i can not eat veal , i can not wear fur , i can not go hunting .
.
.
do you want to go hunting ?
well , i would like to have the option !
!
what is up ?
hey , rachel !
!
oh !
no , you can not go there !
you know how i feel about these big massage places  !
they are putting people like me out of business !
and she wants to go hunting , too !
!
phoebe , come on , i do not want to waste it !
it would be like throwing away a hundred bucks !
ok , this is not about the money , ok ?
it is about .
.
.
it is about corporate greed destroying our hearts and leaving us .
.
.
the hollow shells .
i do not care about any of that !
!
well , do you care about friendship ?
oh !
i feel really strongly about this , rachel .
please , do not use this gift certificate .
I am asking you as a friend .
oh , not as a friend , phoebe !
!
fine , i will not use it !
promise ?
i promise .
thank you .
but i am going hunting !
!
hey honey !
i missed you today !
oh , yeah ?
yeah .
what d'you want to do tonight ?
oh , well .
.
.
maybe we could .
.
.
ok , trying to turn me on by making a mess ?
know your audience !
besides , tomorrow we are doing those fertility tests and until then you need to keep your tadpoles in the tank .
we really need to take those tests ?
honey , we have been trying to have a baby for over a year .
i think it is a good idea to find out if everything's ok .
just a few routine tests .
but i do not want to do it in a cup !
what is the big deal ?
it is weird !
in a doctor's office ?
it is not ok to do it in a doctor's office but it is ok to do it in a parked car behind a taco bell ?
i cannot believe ross told you that !
and in my defense , it was a wendy's !
look , i do not want to do this test either , but i really do think it is a good idea !
yeah , ok .
I am sure that doctor's office can not be worst than on a class trip to the hershey's factory !
oh !
oh , yeah !
rachel talks too !
who says that wine has to cost more than milk !
heeey !
come on in , how are ya ?
can i offer you a drink ?
uh oh .
i hade a pretty hectic day at work too , today i had to open a door and go  ohhhh !
hey , if you need a tour guide .

ok , what do you want to see first ?
ok !
i know , yeah !

ok .
do we have to talk like that then they are not around ?
oh , no , no !
listen , is there someone who can fill in for me ?
but that woman can not know i work here .
she is a friend of mine and i made this big stink about how awful this massage chains are .
because it is good money !
but that does not change the fact that this is an evil blood sucking corporate machine !
ok , are they listening ?
ross !
hi !
i need to talk to you about charlie .
oh , do you , do you really ?
yeah , I am .
.
.
I am kind of having a little problem .
look , if you do not know what the word acrimonious  means , just do not use it !
no , look , you know charlie , right ?
she is cool , she is funny , her body is soo .
.
.
get to the problem !
yes .
it is just that she is so much smarter than all the girls I have ever dated !
combined !
i do not want her to think I am stupid !
are you wearing two belts ?
eh , what do you know !
you were saying you did not want to seem stupid .
right , right , right , well , she wants to go to all this cultural places and i do not know how to talk about that stuff .
you got to help me out !
you know , i really do not want to get involved in you guy's relationship .
please , c'mon , you are the smartest person i know and i really like this girl , ok , i do not want to lose her .
fine .
thanks .
ok .
let us see .
oh , you should take her to the met !
the metsss !
oh , no !
the met !
the metropolitan museum of art .
oh , that is what she meant !
you know , if they are going to shorten it , they should call it the muse !
you know , short for museum , and avoid all the confusion !
yeah , most of it it is a place packed with confused angry baseball fans !
ok , all right , so I will take her to the met .
yeah , uh , uh , ok , there is this great rare bookstore on madison avenue .
you know what ?
she loves architecture , you know what you should do ?
you should take a walk down fifth to the saint patrick's cathedral and there there is this great little pastry shop that she would love .
geez , sounds like you should be going on this date !
but I am not !
.
you know what if you are in the mood for thai food .
.
.
whoa , whoa , whoa !
slow down , you go way too fast .
ok ?
just go back to the met , ok ?
ok .
you got to tell me exactly what to do there .
ok , when you walk in the museum , take the right , that is the antiquities wing .
ancient egypt , mesopotamia , up to the byzantine empire .
whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa !
so , i walk in the door and make the right  i have a weird feeling about this place .
how do i know that they are not going to secretly videotape me and put it all over the internet .
because , honey , i mean this in the sweetest way possible , nobody is going to want to watch that .
deposit my specimen ?
you know , usually i have to call a 900 number for that kind of talk .
thanks , got it .
hey , honey , my test is down the hall , are you sure you are going to be ok ?
yeah , i guess !
i know this is embarrassing , but nobody cares !
no one here even knows you !
oh , come on !
hey , we are probably fertile , let us go home !
why are you here ?
no no no .
.
.
i mean , why ?
why is she here ?
?
what !
?
this was fun !
but I have got an invasive vaginal exam to get to !
I would love to stay , but i have eh .
.
.

.
.
i think it just fell off .
hello ja  , it is time for your massage , ja !

i wish i knew if that was right !
note the painterly lines and subtle impasto on this canvas .
monet painted quickly and usually outdoors as his elusive subject was light itself .
now , do you have any idea what you just said ?
no , no , my mouth says the words , my brain is thinking monster trucks !
ok now , remember , when you get to the museum , monet is not spelt m of n a y .
i just .
.
.
i wrote that out phonetically for you .
phonetically ?
yeah , yeah that means .
.
.
you know ?
we just .
.
.
we do not have time for this .
ok .
ok , but you know what ?
i got to say , I am really impressed that you were able to memorize all this so quickly !
ah !
I am an actor !
i can memorize anything !
last week on days  i had to say frontal temporal zygomatic craniotomy  .
wow .
what does that mean ?
no idea !
but the guy i said it to dies in the next scene so i guess it means you are going to get eaten by a bear  .
ok !
so let us move on to the renaissance ?
ok , caravaggio uses chiaroscuro here to highlight the anguish of the central figure .
touch it , it is really bumpy !
.
nah ah !
nah ah !
no no no !
no ad libbing and dude , you can not touch the paintings .
come on !
you .
.
.
no !
my specimen is in the room and i just want to thank whoever knocked on the door while i was in there .
really helped speed the process along !
janice !
you are not .
.
.
gone ?
yeah !
yeah .
.
.
the hard part is over !
i have not .
.
.
i have not even thought about the results yet .
.
.
i just assumed that everything was going to be ok .
yeah , but what if it is not ?
what if there is a reason why we can not have a baby ?
oh , oh , yeah , ok , thanks .
i can not believe i did not even think of that .
i guess i was just so worried about having to .
.
.
come here and do .
.
.
'that ' .
.
.
it was a wendy's !
!
ipan stripan , glupi glabi !
and that is the swedish national anthem !
thank you for asking !
wow , ikea .
.
.
what a rich culture .
uhm , you know what ?
i have a friend who is a masseuse .
oh , ja !
ja !
yah !
she is .
.
.
uhm .
.
.
not very good though .
.
.
uhu , uhu .
.
.
and why do you think that is ?
i do not know .
.
.
maybe it is because she has got such callousy fingers from playing crummy guitar .
.
.
or .
.
.
maybe she has trouble loosening your knots because you are such a high maintenance tight ass !
phoebe !
!
you know it is me ?
for like a half an hour !
man , you can lie about sweden !
how can you come here ?
how could you not tell me you worked here ?
i do not have to tell you everything !
yes you do , if you are going to make me feel guilty for getting a free massage !
tips not included .
oh !
phoebe , why did you lie to me about working here ?
because i was ashamed ok ?
i sold out for the cash !
and then they give me benefits like medical , and dental , and a 401k .
but you know .
.
.
you pay a price .
now I am this corporate stooge and punching a clock and ugh !
paying taxes !
phoebe , honey , if you hate it so much , you should walk out there right now and quit !
be true to what you believe in !
honey , you have principles and i so admire that !
i do not have any !
you know what ?
you are right .
i am going to quit .
it is time i took my life back !
good for you pheebs !
ok .
okay  if you guys have microphones in there too , i did not mean any of that .
i love you .
haha !
got ya !
die , die , die !
respectfully , professor are .
geller .
hey !
hey , how was the met ?
yeah ?
joey really knows his art , huh ?
what do you mean ?
wait a minute .
.
.
when you guys walked into the met , did you go to the right ?
oh joey , joey !
but still , i mean , it seems like you guys are having a great time together .
what ?
what , i mean , a little , but no , what , go on .
yeah .
but you know what ?
i think you should give joey a chance .
i mean , he is a great guy , and sure he does not know that much about art but you know , you can always talk about that with someone else .
and if you think about it , i mean the reason he memorized all that stuff is because he thought it was important to you .
you know , that is the kind of guy joey is .
that was going to be my next argument .
hey !
hey !
you are ready ?
hey ross !
that art stuff worked , you hooked me up .
glad i could help man .
although some of that stuff was not where you said it was going to be , but .
.
.
i made it work .
it is not okay that I am aroused by this now .
hello ?
oh hi , doctor connelly .
no , she is not here but , you know , i can tell her .
should i be sitting down for this ?
oh .
well , so what does that mean ?
ok .
ok , thank you .
thanks .
hey sweetie .
doctor connelly just called .
with good news ?
of course it is not good news , you just said  doctor connelly just called  .
if it was good news you would have said  doctor connelly just called !
but so what is it ?
is there a problem , uh ?
is there a problem with me or with you ?
actually it is both of us .
what ?
apparently my sperm have low motility and you have an inhospitable environment .
oh .
.
.
what does that mean ?
it means that my guys will not get off their barcaloungers and you have a uterus that is prepared to kill the ones that do .
it means .
.
.
chandler ?
it means that we can keep trying , but there is a good chance this may never happen for us .
oh my god !
I am sorry .
I am sorry too .
well , we are going to .
.
.
we are going to figure this out .
i know .
good morning receptionist .
rachel green ?

if you were bigger you would hit me , huh .
.
.
?
aaaaaahhhhhh  I am sorry .
.
.
I am sorry .
it is obviously way too early for us to be .
.
.
having that conversation .
maybe not , is it ?
i know mike , why do not you keep digging ?
oh , it is a key .
to be honest , i think I would prefer the five dollars .
oh wow , ooh !
ooh , big step for phoebe and mike .
oh no , i want to .
yeah .
.
.
ooh .
.
.
wow .
.
.
even started to think I would never meet someone that , you know , i wanted to .
.
.
do this with .
here you go .
it really is .
oh , i know it .
.
.
it is amazing these little things open doors .
.
.
huh !
so i do not go back to work for another four weeks , but we would like our nanny to start right away , so that emma could get a chance to know her .
that is great , great .
so do you have any questions for us ?
allright .
well thank you so much for coming .
.
.
thank you .
really nice to meet you .
.
.

okidoki !
wow !
we are never going to find a nanny .
oh , come on rach , we will .
i promise .
we have more interviews  and worse comes to worse , we can always reconsider the uhm .
.
.
the first one we met with .
what , the blonde with no bra ?
she was blonde ?
just a sec .
!
okay , okay .
this one's name is sandy .
she is got a degree in early childhood education , uhm .
.

no .
.
.
I am .
.
.
I am just .
.
.
I am the worst person ever .
how can i not tell david that I am seeing mike ?
maybe he did not give you a chance .
he said : are you seeing someone ?
and i said no .
.
.
oh , well .
.
.
that had been your window .
yeah !
i mean , i do not know .
i was just  , i was looking , i was looking in his eyes and i was just thinking : oh my god !

david's here .
he is just , he is so irresistible .

the scientist guy ?

chandler ?
continue .
.
.
oh.okay , then it gets worse , because then i told him that i would see him tomorrow night .
phoebe !

and .
.
.
and .
.
.
and .
.
.
i like mike so much , you know .
it is just going really well .
oh my god !
wow , is not it ironic that david would show up on the same day that you and mike exchange keys ?
uhuh .
.
.
yeah .
.
.
!
, you know .
and given my life long search for irony , you can imagine how happy i am .
what are you going to do ?
i mean i guess , i just have to .
.
.
tell david that nothing can happen between us .
unless i do not .
.
.
you know , complicated moral situation , no right , no wrong .
.
.
you have to tell david !
okay , i knew i should have had this conversation with joey .

can all states have stuff like that ?
hey yeah , I am from the waistband , wyoming .
but when i was seven , we headed over to the crotch .

and do not get me started on the way that people from tulsa talk .
okay .
what is with the word you all ?
you know , just .
.
.
two words just .
.
.
pushed together .
.
.
are we all allowed to do that , because if so , i say why stop there ?
you know , your new poodle could be your noodle .
and fried chicken ?
could be fricken.waiter , waiter excuse me , I will have the fricken ?
see , that is .
.
.
that is funny with the fricken , right ?
no , it just remind me of something this guy did today at work .
i told you about that funny guy , geoffrey , right ?
yeah , he came up .
.
.
well , he did this bit .
.
.
you probably had to be there , but it was liza minelli locked in our freezer , eating a raw chicken .
were you there ?
no , but it sounds like it was fricken funny .
.
.
sandy , that is exactly what it is .
.
.
are you gay ?
ross !
oh !
oh , that is pretty .
so you are just like a .
.
.
guy who is a nanny ?

well , if that is what they do in minsk .
.
.
in new york .

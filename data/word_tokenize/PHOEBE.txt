ok , I will fight for her . ok ! oh , wait , oh i just realized . . . if i do that , that means you do not get her . hi ! sorry , I am late . no , he really hates it . but he is going to let me keep my box of human hair ! so you got to pick your battles . but the good news is , gladys is yours ! oh , she is that work of art i made , you know , with the woman coming out of the frame . oh , i did not know you wanted her too ! girls , girls , stop , ok ? we will flip a coin . heads , she is rachel 's , tails she is monica 's . . tails ! monica , she is yours ! well , gladys say hello to your new home ! yeah , yeah ! and you can get rid of that french poster . really ? it does not have anything coming out of it . or maybe there is some place for her in your bedroom ? hey ! you guys ! you guys ! you do not have to fight over her anymore . whoever does not get gladys gets glynnis . i knew it ! ok , so this is pretty much what is happened so far . ross was in love with rachel since , you know , forever , but every time he tried to tell her , something kind of got in the way , like cats , and italian guys . finally chandler was like forget about her but when ross was in china on his dig , chandler let it slip that ross was in love with rachel . she was like , oh my god . so she went to the airport to meet him when he came back , but what she did not know was , that ross was getting off the plane with another woman . uh oh ! so , that is pretty much everything you need to know . but , enough about us . so , how 've you been ? oh my god . this is huge . this is bigger than huge . this is like , all right , what is bigger than huge ? yes . because , you know , if you do not look good , we do not look good . i love that voice . oh , ok . how , it is been so long since you have had sex , you are wondering if they have changed it ? all right , so what were you thinking ? ohh ! no . because , I am just , I am incredibly anal and an unbelievable control freak . i know I am not , but you are , and i was trying to spare your feelings . I am still on no . what is goin ' on ? ewww ! where ? ok , you are going to have to not touch my ass . all right . ok , but , but ! you have to promise that you will not be all like control y and bossy and monica about it . all right . now some of you are going to get cut , and some of you are not . but i promise none of you are going to feel a thing . all right , that is it , i quit . yeah , but this is not the face of a person who trusts a person . ok , this is the face of a person who , you know , does not trust a person . would you relax ? i know what i am doing . this is how he wears it . demi moore . well , he was a he in arthur , and in ten . oh . oh ! oh my god ! oh my god !

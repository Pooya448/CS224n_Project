! what do i do ? they re not listening too me ? monica you really think i should try this phasing out thing ? all right , keep going . we are phasing the accent out , phasing it out . so without out re testing the results in the laboratory the team would never have identified the initial errors in their carbon dating analysis . were there any questions at this point ? yes . come again ? what s what s this nonsense ? all right , i m i m not english . i m from long island . i was really nervous and the accent just uh , just came out . i m sorry . so , if we could just get back to the lecture . umm , were there any questions ? about paleontology . all right , look i was just trying to make a good first impression . obviously , i screwed up . but what you guys think of me is really important because i m i m hoping to get a permanent job here . so if you just give me another chance to make a good impression well , hello rachel ! what did you want to show us ?
